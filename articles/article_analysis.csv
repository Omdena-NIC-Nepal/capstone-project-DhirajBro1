Deforestation and unregulated extraction of resources in the youngest and most fragile of the Himalayan ranges have disrupted groundwater recharge and increased soil erosion, contributing to the current water crisis.

Activists criticize the government for blaming global climate change to deflect from local accountability and for neglecting Chure’s conservation while focusing on Himalayan snowmelt.

Despite conservation efforts, government plans to export construction materials from Chure continue, risking further environmental damage and criminal influence.

KATHMANDU — Until a few years ago, villagers in Siraha in Nepal’s Madhesh province accessed water by digging a few meters into the ground, as this method was easier than laying pipes. Water gushed readily from the ground.

However, residents like Sunil Yadav from Siraha district now must dig at least 30 meters (100 feet) to find water. Even deep wells run dry during peak summer as heat waves increase demand.

Ironically, during the monsoon season from July to September, the region appears water-abundant due to heavy rainfall, which at times washes away entire settlements and agricultural fields. “When we don’t need water, there’s too much of it, but when we need it, there’s not enough,” Yadav said at an event in Kathmandu.

Activists such as Yadav argue that policymakers in Kathmandu conveniently attribute this crisis to global climate change to attract international attention and deflect local accountability. Although climate change plays a role, the primary causes lie in the government’s failure over the past decade to regulate extractive industries in the fragile Chure range, also known as the water reservoir of the plans, critics say.

The Chure range, the youngest and southernmost chain of the Himalayas, stretches from the banks of the Indus River in Pakistan in the west to that of the Brahmaputra in the east. This “fragile” range, formed by river deposits, plays a crucial role in groundwater retention and recharge in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, one of the world’s most densely populated areas. It also serves as a corridor for the east-west movement of megafauna such as sloth bears, leopards and tigers.

Historically, human activity in the Chure, made up of loose topsoil, was minimal due to malaria. “However, after malaria eradication in the 1950s, people began exploiting the area for its forest resources and construction materials like gravel and sand,” said Binod Bhatta, leader of the government-appointed committee to develop a master plan for the conservation and development of Chure-Tarai Madhesh.

Previously, the Chure’s tree cover allowed water to percolate into the soil, recharging the water table. Now, with massive deforestation, high-intensity rainfall, linked to climate change, causes flash floods and soil erosion without replenishing the groundwater. All this is happening as the Indo-Gangetic Plain reels under severe heat waves.

Activist Shristi Singh Shrestha criticized the government’s focus on Himalayan snowmelt at the expense of addressing Chure’s issues. “We also saw at a recentevent on mountains and climate change in Nepalthat the government didn’t give much priority to the Chure, as it is also a part of the Himalayas,” she said. “When officials talk about melting snow cover, they can blame the developed countries for accelerating climate change, but if they talk about the Chure, the finger would point towards themselves as they are the ones responsible for its crisis,” she added.

Unregulated urbanization— especially along major highways in Nepal, which started during the decade-long Maoist insurgency — and the push to develop mega infrastructure projects such as highways, tunnels, railways and hydropower has led to an insatiable demand in the country for construction raw materials. However, as regulation and monitoring of extraction-based industries and coordination among the federal, provincial and local governments has been minimal, the sector has become a hotbed for crime and corruption. News reports of local politicians being implicated in corruption cases related to mining have becomecommonplace in local media outlets.

Back in 2010, then-President Ram Baran Yadav launched thePresident Chure Conservation Programout of concern for the future of the plains. However, the program, which has spent millions of dollars on conserving the Chure, struggles against powerful extractive industries due to weak enforcement.

Environmental activists say even they face threats and violence. On Jan. 10, 2020, 24-year-old Dilip Mahato, an outspoken critic of illegal sand mining in Dhanusha district, was murdered. “His death has instilled fear in others, silencing opposition against miners,” said an activist from western Nepal who didn’t want to be named for safety reasons. He said the mine operators fund political campaigns and help politicians who back their operations to come to power. “This means that the people in power won’t take any action against the miners,” the activist said.

Despite making international pledges to combat climate change and failing to regulate the mining sector, the government seeks to export construction materials to the lucrative market in India. In 2021, protests forced the government to retract a budget proposal to export Chure’s pebbles and sand, which opposition parties such as the Nepali Congress likened to “burning one’s own house to sell ashes.”

Currently, a new law under discussion in Parliament, theConstruction Materials (Management and Regulation) Bill,aims to reopen the export of construction materials. The Nepali Congress, now a ruling coalition partner.

Chure expert Bijay Singh Danuwar warns this will exacerbate extraction, attract Indian involvement and introduce criminal elements that could influence local and federal elections. “Then the whole thing will go out of our control,” he said.

Activists and conservationists say that while Nepal requires construction materials for development, extraction must occur in a planned and regulated manner. Extraction of pebbles and sand is also necessary to maintain the course of the river, said Danuwar. But it has to be regulated and planned.

“Scientific assessments should guide minimal damage extraction practices, balancing development needs with environmental conservation,” Bhatta said.

Meanwhile, expansion of unplanned and unregulated settlements continues in different sections of Chure. Cities such as Sindhuli, Bardibas and Hetauda in the east and Dang in the west continue to expand with people encroaching on forest land. This could make the crisis more complex, said retired forester Amardeep Yadav.

The government has been trying to provide land titles to families that have been living in these towns for generations without land ownership. It has had limited success in doing so, as the Supreme Court recently ordered that thegovernment can’t distribute forest landto squatters. However, officials in the know suggest that the government might bring in new legislation to facilitate the registration of land ownership. This could add more pressure to the Chure, activists warn.

ADB Approves $30 Million Financing to Strengthen Climate Resilience in Nepal

The Climate-Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods Project will help communities in 24 municipalities prepare catchment management plans to ensure effective water resources management and water security.

The Climate-Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods Project will help communities in 24 municipalities prepare catchment management plans to ensure effective water resources management and water security.

News from Country Offices | 30 September 2024

MANILA, PHILIPPINES (30 September 2024) — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $30 million financing package to improve climate resilience, water resources management, and livelihoods of communities in Karnali and Sudurpashchim provinces in Nepal.

“Nepal is increasingly at risk from the devastating impacts of climate change, as extreme weather events become more frequent. The Karnali and Sudurpashchim provinces are assessed to be the most vulnerable regions to climate change, largely owing to the poor communities’ low coping capacity” said ADB Environment Specialist Sumit Pokhrel. “This project will help communities in the targeted project areas to be more climate-resilient, build their capacity to preserve and manage their natural resources, and expand nature-based livelihood opportunities that will boost the local economy.”

The package comprises a $10 million concessional loan and a $20 million grant from theAsian Development Fund, which provides grants to ADB’s poorest and most vulnerable developing member countries.

TheClimate-Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods Projectwill help communities in 24 municipalities prepare catchment management plans to ensure effective water resources management and water security. The project will support the construction of small-scale drinking water systems and gravity-fed irrigation facilities. It will introduce water and soil conservation measures to protect landscapes from adverse effects of climate change. This includes the construction of soil erosion, surface runoff control, and infiltration structures; slope and stream bank stabilization; and land cover improvements such as nurseries, restoration of barren lands, and agroforestry.

ADB will provide grants to support nature-based livelihood investments such as the cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants, non-timber forestry products, and indigenous crops. This will improve income opportunities of farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises, including women entrepreneurs. The project will also promote ecotourism in the region to diversify local communities’ income sources.

The project will build the capacity of federal, provincial and local governments to effectively plan, manage, and monitor water infrastructure, watersheds, and livelihood projects. At the local level, the project will train and inform communities on land and water preservation and conservation, and on nature-based livelihood opportunities.

ADB will administer an additional $2 million grant financed by the Community Resilience Partnership Program Trust Fund (CRPPTF) under the Community Resilience Financing Partnership Facility, which is dedicated to financing women-led small and medium enterprises. An additional $1.25 million grant from ADB’s Technical Assistance Special Fund and $500,000 from the CRPPTF is allocated for capacity building towards livelihood enhancement, ecotourism promotion, geographical indication, and independent project monitoring.

ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 69 members—49 from the region.

Application Open for a Capacity Building and Reporting Opportunity on Climate Change and DRR in the Nepal-India Context

Overview of the Initiative

The ""Strengthening Transboundary Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Reporting in the Nepal-India Context"" initiative, implemented by Youth Innovation Lab with support from UNESCO Nepal, aims to enhance the capacity of media organizations in Nepal and India to effectively report on climate change and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). This initiative targets the shared climate challenges faced by both countries, with a specific focus on the impacts of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), natural resource extraction, and other climate-induced disasters across the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region.

The project aims to foster regional collaboration, improve data-driven journalism, and combat climate misinformation. It also seeks to strengthen investigative reporting through the integration of AI and digital tools such as data visualization, fact-checking, and geospatial mapping. This will empower journalists to report on climate issues with greater accuracy, depth, and context, ultimately contributing to more informed public discourse and policymaking.

Program objectives

Improve the capacity of media organizations in Nepal and India to report effectively on:

Climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation strategies in the context of natural resource extraction and the HKH region.

Many Hatuwagadhi locals began abandoning rice farming since 2013 due to unpredictable weather and poor yields. PHOTO: THE KATHMANDU POST

February 17, 2025

BHOJPUR– On a recent morning, Anita Rai made her way down the steep hill from Kattike Bisauni Chowk, in Hatuwagadhi Rural Municipality of Bhojpur district, carrying bags of rice on her back. Just a decade ago, her family would have been collecting rice directly from their own fields. In the heart of Hatuwagadi, a bustling administrative and commercial hub of the area, rice traders now transport goods via tractor to the market, and locals like Anita are left to carry such goods on their backs to their residences.

“Once, we relied on our crops for sustenance,” Anita recalls. “We grew rice, maize, millet, pulses, and seasonal vegetables. We raised cows and buffaloes for milk and dairy products, and we only had to buy a few items like salt, oil, and sugar when needed.”

For years, families like Anita’s in ward 2 of Hatuwagadi, in the southern part of Bhojpur, have lived off traditional agriculture. The village was once a place of peace, with a close-knit community, the sight of the snow-capped Kanchenjunga range in the distance, and a mild climate. But recently, things have started to change drastically.

The village, situated about 1,350 to 1,450 metres above sea level, has been facing the adverse effects of climate change. Shifting rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts have led to decreased agricultural productivity. Traditionally, maize would be sown by the end of April, and rice transplanted by mid-July, but this routine is now being disrupted by unpredictable weather. For example, there has been less rain at crucial times, leading to poor rice yields, where husks grow instead of grains.

Many locals have begun abandoning rice farming since 2013. Fields that once thrived with crops have become overgrown with shrubs and brush. Some villagers have left their fields fallow due to persistent crop damage caused by pests and changing weather patterns.

Maize, another staple crop in Hatuwagadi, is also being ravaged by the drought. Ram Prasad Rai, a 61-year-old local farmer, explains, “For the past four to five years, drought has affected our maize, and pests have been eating away at it from root to leaf. We can no longer rely on it.”

The local economy is feeling the strain. “Every year, we have to spend around 40,000 rupees for rice,” Gita Rai, another farmer in the locality, says. This has become a common reality for many families, who once grew enough rice for the entire year but now find themselves purchasing food for survival. “The rise in pest infestations in fruits and vegetables has made it necessary to use pesticides, adding further financial burden to farmers,” she added.

Hatuwagadi is not the only victim of this havoc caused by the changing climatic patterns and climate change.The “National Climate Change Survey 2022” published by the National Statistics Office, 65.4 percent of households across Nepal have reported experiencing droughts, and over 50 percent have noticed a rise in crop diseases. Additionally, 87 percent of the respondents said they have observed a change in rainfall patterns.

For Anita’s family, this means relying on maize and rice crops that no longer sustain them. “We have to spend Rs100,000 to Rs150,000 on rice and maize every year,” Anita explains. Her husband works as a migrant labourer in India, while she struggles to manage the household, send children to school, and take care of the farm. It’s been six to seven years of this relentless routine.

This rising burden of climate-induced food insecurity also highlights the increasing role women play in managing the household while their male relatives work abroad. “In the past, the village was vibrant, with men and women working together. Now, most men leave for foreign jobs because farming no longer provides enough for the family,” says Bichari Thapa, the ward chair.

Since 2004, Hatuwagadi has seen some development, such as road and electricity expansion. However, these improvements are overshadowed by the ever-growing problem of drought, water scarcity, and a decline in agricultural productivity. “Once, the village was filled with life, but now, people from six or seven different settlements rarely stay in their homes anymore,” says Deependra Thapa, another victim of the nature-induced havoc.

The struggle in Hatuwagadi is a stern warning of the far-reaching consequences of climate change. Manish Raj Pandey, head of the Climate Change Section at the National Trust for Nature Conservation, the region is increasingly affected by erratic weather patterns—prolonged droughts followed by flash floods and landslides. These events are depleting soil fertility and increasing pest infestations, all of which have dire consequences for food production.

The longer-term consequences of these disruptions are not yet fully clear, but the immediate impacts are undeniable. As roads have improved and access to markets has increased, the forest, once rich with life and resources, is being cleared for timber. This has created some short-term income but also raises concerns about future landslides and erosion.

“The expansion of roads and illegal timber trade is causing more problems,” says a local under anonymity. “When the land dries up, water sources also dry up. And once the forest is gone, there’s no turning back.”

As climate change continues to disrupt life in Hatuwagadi, the struggle for survival becomes even more challenging. The once fertile land that nourished generations is now at risk of becoming a wasteland, and with it, the livelihoods of many rural families.",title village nepal face wrath climate change asia news

BaYu Sambaad: Centering Children and Youth in Nepal’s Climate Agenda – Government of Nepal, United Nations in Nepal

English

नेपाली

KATHMANDU, 26 April 2025 –More than 100 children and young people from across Nepal convened in Kathmandu today for the Balbalika tatha Yuwa (BaYu) Sambaad, a children and youth-led national dialogue on climate action ahead of the international Sagarmatha Sambaad. With nearly half of Nepal’s population under the age of 24, the event underscored a powerful reality: children and youth are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, and they are calling for concerted and urgent climate action.

Jointly organized by the Government of Nepal and United Nations Nepal including UNICEF, FAO and UNDP with a consortium of youth networks, namely Nepalese Youth for Climate Action, Mountain Youth Hub, World Food Forum Nepal, Global Youth Biodiversity Network and Clean Energy Nepal, the event placed children and young people at the centre of the climate conversation. Representatives from the government, civil society, development partners, private sectors, media and climate experts joined the dialogue to listen to, learn from and stand with young people.

“Climate change is not a future concern, it is today’s reality”, said 20-year-old Nischal Bhatt. “We, young people, have the passion and power to bring change. We urge for an enabling environment where we can contribute to a climate just and resilient society”.

Despite contributing the least to climate change, children and youth bear the brunt of its consequences from exposure to extreme heat, heavy rainfall, climate induced disasters, polluted air and water, to increased health risks, poor nutrition and learning disruptions. In Nepal, climate change has been linked to a rise in vector-borne diseases, food insecurity and school closures, all challenges that disproportionately impact children.

“Every child has the right to grow up in a safe and healthy environment. Yet, climate change threatens children’s rights every day,” said Dr. Alice Akunga, United Nations Resident Coordinator to Nepal ad interim. “But today’s Sambaad proves that children and young people are not just victims - they are powerful agents of change. Their voices must shape our climate response at every level.”

The BaYu Sambaad featured an exhibition of child- and youth-led climate solutions, video show, expert sessions on climate resilience, and two intergenerational panel discussions. The first explored the impact of climate change on essential services like education, health and water . The second aligned with the themes of the upcoming Sagarmatha Sambaad – scheduled from 16 to 18 May – highlighting the connections between climate change, mountain ecosystems and the future of humanity. The Sambaad also included testimonies of children, adolescent and youths from across the Nepal.

A key outcome of the BaYu Sambaad is a declaration developed by the participating children and youth, outlining their demands, commitments and proposed actions for a more climate-resilient Nepal. This declaration will be submitted to the Sagarmatha Sambaad Secretariat ahead of the Sagarmatha Sambaad, ensuring the perspectives of children and young people directly inform Nepal’s climate policy, including the development of the third Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and preparations for COP30.

“Nepal is proud to be a global leader in putting youth and children at the center of our climate commitments,” said Hon. Minister of Forests and Environment, Mr. Ain Bahadur Shahi Thakuri, chief guest at the event. “Our second NDC already reflects this, and is among the most inclusive globally in terms of the needs of children and youth, and we are committed to making NDC 3.0 even more so. The BaYu Sambaad is an essential platform to translate  young people’s voices into action – in policy, in practice, and in our path toward a greener, more resilient Nepal.”

Chair of the programme Dr. Rajendra Prasad Mishra, Secretary of the Ministry of Forests and Environment, praised the initiative led by children and young people and stated that the conclusions from the BaYu Sambaad would guide Nepal’s policies and plans.

Children and Youth at the Center of Nepal’s Climate Change Agenda

Kathmandu, April 27: More than 100 children and youth from across the country have expressed concern about climate change and the crisis it has created.

Gathered for the Children and Youth Dialogue in the capital on Saturday, they discussed climate change response led by children and youth in the context of the international ‘Sagarmatha Dialogue’ being organized by the government.

At the program, 20-year-old Nischal Bhatta said climate change is not a concern of the future, it is a reality of today. “We demand an environment conducive to ensuring climate justice and building a climate-resilient society.”

The first session discussed the impact of climate change on basic services such as education, health and water. The second session highlighted mountain ecology, climate change and the future of humanity, in line with the main theme of the Sagarmatha Dialogue to be held from 16 to 18 May.

In the dialogue, children, adolescents and youth shared their first-hand experiences on climate change and the efforts they are making at their level. A key achievement of the program was the declaration prepared by the participating children and youth.

The declaration includes their demands, commitments and proposed actions for building a climate-resilient Nepal.

An unprecedented incident of extreme rainfall hit Nepal in late September 2024. Some areas of the country reported their highest amount of precipitation in more than 50 years. The whole country was put on alert, but ultimately, floods and landslides associated with the delugeclaimed 244 lives.

A new attribution study indicates that human-induced climate change made this extreme weather nearly 70% more likely and 10% more intense.Roshan Jha, a coauthor of the new study and a Ph.D. research scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,presentedthe team’s findings on 10 December at AGU’s Annual Meeting 2024 in Washington, D.C. Jha collaborated with 19 other scientists from five countries on the research.

The study’s key conclusions were based on data provided by local weather stations in Nepal as well as climate modeling analyses.

Monsoon Season

The torrential rainfall occurred during the region’s annual monsoon season, in which moisture from the Indian Ocean is transported toward the Himalayas.

Kathmandu Valley is especially vulnerable to heavy monsoon rains. During the September event, Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital and largest city, received323.5 millimeters of rainfallin a span of 24 hours.

“This is a valley kind of thing,” said Jha. “Whenever the rainfall occurs, the rain comes to the center [of the valley] from all over it.”

The increasing intensity of the monsoon “is attributed to climate change because with climate change, we know the atmosphere has more capacity to hold the moisture.”

The increasing intensity of the monsoon “is attributed to climate change because with climate change, we know the atmosphere has more capacity to hold the moisture.”

The frequency and intensity of monsoon-related events in Kathmandu and across Nepal have been “increasing since 1980,” said Jha, “and that is attributed to climate change because with climate change, we know the atmosphere has more capacity to hold the moisture.”

To quantify the role of human-induced climate change in this extreme weather event, Jha and his coauthors first averaged the maximum 3-day accumulated rainfall measurements in central and eastern Nepal during monsoon season between 1971 and 2024. They also created models of the event under preindustrial conditions as well as current global mean surface temperature.

Jha and his coauthors used data collected by local stations affiliated with Nepal’s Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, reanalysis data fromERA5(the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts tool), and global precipitation data from theMulti-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitationproduct.

The results were consistent with scientists’ predictions. “We got matches with the theoretical estimates,” said Jha.

Unplanned Urbanization

Unplanned urbanization also contributed to the devastation brought by extreme weather, the report concluded.

For example, the Bagmati River, which flows through Kathmandu, hadpreviously been reroutedto make way for housing and industrial development. Such urbanization meant the river’s floodplains were increasingly constrained. “And because of that,” Jha explained, the river was “not able to accommodate that much streamflow.”

Nepal is one of theworld’s fastest-urbanizing countries, and the Kathmandu Valley is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in South Asia. It has an estimated population ofnearly 3 million, and that number is increasing by about6.5% every year.

According to Jha and his coauthors, the past 30 years have seen a 386% increase in built-up areas in Kathmandu Valley, especially in the valley’s fertile floodplains. Forest cover in the region, meanwhile, has declined 28%, they said.

“The conclusion that they have drawn does make sense” and is consistent with other studies, saidDivas B. Basnyat, who heads the Water and Climate Program at the Nepal Development Research Institute.

Basnyat, who was not involved in the new research but has led previous studies on climate risks in Kathmandu Valley, said that extreme monsoon-related rainfall events are becoming less unusual. Events previously associated with 50-year or even 100-year floods are now occurring much more frequently, he said.

As a resident of Kathmandu whose family has been living there for generations, Basnyat noted that older neighborhoods built on high ground are not affected as much by extreme rainfall events. Newer developments, however, have been built close to the river and are in grave danger of future extreme events.

The new study supported this pattern. It found that informal settlements constructed along riverbanks or in flood-prone areas are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events.

But Basnyat also noted that the climate data used in the new study have limitations. “We have to also accept the availability of data in Kathmandu and the area is scarce.” Furthermore, he continued, “the variability in the mountainous areas like Nepal and the Himalayas can be a lot, even in a short distance.”

Climate change and its silent impact on sexual and reproductive health in Nepal

Vulnerability in the face of climate change

Howdoes climate change influence sexual and reproductive health?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions when people learn that climate change affects sexual and reproductive health. Most people in Nepal are unaware that climate change has an impact on their sexual health, and these issues are not of main concern to them.

Nepal, with its diverse ecosystems and intricate geography, ranks among the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries. Extreme weather events—those storms and floods that reshape lives—have left their mark here. Picture this: Nepal, nestled in the top 10 countries impacted by climate chaos between 2000 and 2019. But it’s not just about melting glaciers or shifting monsoons; it’s about how these changes ripple through communities.

The indigenous communities of Nepal, comprising 4,755 individuals, are deeply connected to their natural surroundings. Their livelihoods depend on agriculture and the delicate balance of natural resources. Yet, as climate change tightens its grip, these communities face unprecedented challenges. The rising temperatures, the heat waves, the drying water sources—they’re not just abstract concepts. They’re the threads that weave into the fabric of daily life.

A study conducted by Ipas Nepal,, highlights climate vulnerability among these communities and how it intersects with sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).

Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study surveyed 384 women, conducted 12 group discussions, and facilitated 22 in-depth interviews—this data collection aimed to paint a vivid picture of the realities faced by women in these communities.

A changing climate

The findings are alarming. An overwhelming 88% of women reported experiencing hotter summers, while 53% noted colder winters. More concerning, 78% observed erratic rainfall patterns leading to devastating floods and landslides. These climate-induced events severely hamper access to healthcare, resulting in decreased maternal care, unintended pregnancies and, tragically, maternal and infant mortality.

“Rain does not fall during the monsoon season; last year, it occurred during the flowering season of paddy, causing all of the paddy to fall and get soaked in rainwater. The rain does not occur when needed in the month of Asadh/Shrawan,” lamented a woman from midstream, Banganga.

“The winter rainfall does not occur. As winter rain is delaying, the timing for wheat harvesting is also changing,” noted a participant from upstream, Khutiya.

Climate change isn’t just about weather patterns—it’s about survival. In the Khutiya basin, 93% of women observed delayed monsoons, forcing 100% of farmers to rely on irrigation pump sets. With unpredictable rainfall, crop production has plummeted, intensifying these communities’ daily struggles.

Women bear the brunt of these challenges. Displacement due to climate events has led to increased workloads, with 41% of women becoming household heads. They shoulder additional responsibilities such as childcare, cattle tending, collecting firewood (99%), and walking long distances for water (59%)—the arduous task of manually clearing invasive species further compounds their burden.

“More men go to foreign countries or city areas to support the livelihood of their family,” shared a participant from upstream, Khutiya.

“When the river enters the house, our workload increases as we need to carry the floodwater outside the house, and as the river washes the field, we have to clear the sand from the paddy and uproot the grasses from the field,” reported a woman from downstream, Khutiya.

Extreme weather events (such as landslides and floods) often disrupt health facilities and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, highlighting the need for climate-resilient infrastructure. The effect of climate change on women’s sexual and reproductive health is petrifying.

“Because of the workload, there are many cases of miscarriages in the community, and women face uterine prolapse,” shared a participant from midstream, Kailali.

The dark side of climate change: Food insecurity and violence

Climate change has also drastically reduced agricultural productivity, leading to severe food insecurity. Women reported that what was once sufficient for sale is now barely enough for household consumption.

“Production of crops was sufficient for selling purposes but now production has been reduced, making it difficult for household use also,” noted a participant from upstream, Khutiya.

Adding to their woes, women face heightened gender-based violence during and after disasters, encompassing domestic, sexual, societal, and financial abuse.

“Some abusers see the natural calamities as an opportunity to do sexual harassment,” reported a participant from downstream, Khutiya.

“Conflict arises at home during floods when resources are limited, leading to a disturbing environment within the house,” shared a participant from midstream, Khutiya.

These challenges, along with climate disasters, worsen mental health issues among women and girls.

Resilience and the road ahead

Despite these daunting challenges, the resilience of these women shines through. However, their struggle highlights the urgent need for climate adaptation plans that prioritize the needs and voices of women and girls. Ensuring access to contraception and safe abortion services during crises is crucial, as extreme weather events frequently disrupt health facilities and SRHR services. Building climate-resilient infrastructure and promoting gender equality are essential steps toward mitigating these impacts.

This study illustrates that climate change is not just an environmental issue—it’s a profound human rights challenge. Addressing it requires holistic solutions that empower Indigenous women, giving them a central role in crafting and implementing strategies that safeguard their health, rights, and futures.",title

Snow leopards could vanish from Nepal by 2050 under severe climate change, study warns

With temperatures rising and habitats shrinking, Nepal’s big cats face an uncertain future, according to new research

With temperatures rising and habitats shrinking, Nepal’s big cats face an uncertain future, according to new research

“Our modelling shows an alarming scenario, and the impact from climate change is turning out to be worse than predicted,” said Dibesh Karmacharya, the executive director of the Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal and lead researcher of the study.

Though typically found at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 metres in elevation, one snow leopard was discovered at just 146 metres above sea level in eastern Nepal last January. Though some researchers now believe the animal may have simply “lost its way”, others initially attributed its presence far from its usual habitats to climate change.

Despite being an isolated incident, there are an increasing number of studies suggesting that rising temperatures are likely to affect the habitat of Nepal’s apex predators, including snow leopards, tigers and common leopards, ultimately affecting their distribution and population.

Snow leopards are among the most elusive species in the high mountains of Central and South Asia. Nepal is home to between 300 and 500 individuals, accounting for about 10 per cent of the global population.

With declining numbers, they are listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species.

Climate change made downpours behind deadly Nepal floods 10% more intense – Study

By the Climate Centre

The lethallate September floods in Nepalwere caused by rainfall made about 10 per cent more intense by climate change, according tothe latest rapid analysisby World Weather Attribution scientists issued yesterday.

The study highlights the “urgent need to limit development in low-lying, riverside areas of cities and scale up early warning and early action,” a WWA press release says.

Records were broken across central and eastern Nepal last month, with some weather stations recording in a single day the equivalent to about half the total annual rainfall in the British capital, London, well known for its generally rainy climate.The downpours filled streams and, especially, the Bagmati, Sapakoshi, Narayani, Sardu, Rew and Nakkhu rivers and their tributaries, already brimming over after months of the regular monsoon.The subsequent floods and landslides killed more than 200 people, displaced thousands more, destroyed hundreds of homes, damaged hydropower plants, and washed away roads and bridges and other key infrastructure.Roshan Jha, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, said: “These floods turned the streets of Kathmandu into raging rivers. Clearly, climate change is no longer a distant threat in Asia.

“With every fraction of a degree of warming, the atmosphere can potentially hold more moisture, leading to much heavier downpours and catastrophic floods like these.”

‘Clearly, climate change is no longera distant threat in Asia’

The study was conducted by 20 scientists from universities and meteorological agencies in Nepal, India, Sweden, the UK and the US.

Maja Vahlberg, a Technical Adviser at the Climate Centre and one of the joint authors, said today: “This study underscores why Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change.

“Minimizing the construction of homes in unsafe, flood-prone areas will help reduce the impacts of future floods there.“We also know that people who can’t read, a disproportionate number of them women in Nepal, are especially vulnerable to floods as they miss out on information to prepare – so improving education and reducing inequality is vital to make people more resilient to climate change.”

In its immediate response, over 200 Nepal Red Cross personnel worked closely with the authorities on evacuation and search and rescue, and the distribution of essential supplies. The Red Cross was also involved in clearing roads and restoring vehicle access, especially in mountainous areas that saw landslides.IFRC-DREF issued ahumanitarian grantof more than 500,000 Swiss francs to enable the Nepal Red Cross to assist 20,000 people affected by the disaster; as of the beginning of this month, the National Society had distributed emergency relief from prepositioned stocks to nearly 5,000 people.

The Nepal study is the fourth this year by WWA to find that an Asian flood and/or associated wind and landslides have been worsened by climate change, along withTyphoon Gaemiin the western Pacific,northern Keralain India, and theUAE and Oman.

244 people died in central and eastern Nepal last month as record rainfall triggered flash floods, landslides and riverine flooding.

—

Human-made climate change made the heavy rainfall that battered Nepal last month more intense and more likely, new research shows. The three-day event led to flash floods, landslides, and riverine flooding that killed 244 people and brought parts of the country, including the capital Kathmandu, to a standstill.

Rain records were broken across central and eastern Nepal, withsome 25 weather stationsin at least 14 other districts recording more than 320mm of rainfall on September 28, the equivalent of about half of London’s total annual rainfall and the highest recorded in Nepal in the past 54 years. The country began its current system of measuring and recording rainfall in 1970.

The heavy downpours led to the Bagmati, Sapakoshi, and Nakkhu rivers, which were already running high after months of seasonal monsoon rainfall, to overflow, causing widespread devastation and displacing thousands.

A rapid attribution analysis conducted by a group of leading scientistsconcludedthat such a rainfall event is approximately 70% likelier to occur in today’s climate, which is 1.3C warmer than pre-industrial times.

Human-made climate change is also making downpours more intense. An analysis of weather data and climate models revealed that last month’s rain was made 10% heavier by climate change.

A warmer atmosphere, heated by fossil fuel emissions, can hold more moisture, resulting in heavier downpours. For every 1C that Earth’s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmospherecan increase by about 7%.

“Yet again, we’ve seen fatalities from a flood in Asia reach triple digits in 2024,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer at the Centre for Environmental Policy and one of the scientists behind the study by World Weather Attribution (WWA). “The world’s sluggish shift away from oil, gas and coal is resulting in death for the poorest, most vulnerable people. Floods like these will keep getting bigger, deadlier and costlier until fossil fuels are replaced with renewable energy,” added Otto, who is also WWA’s co-lead.

The study, published Wednesday, is the fourth by the group this year highlightinghow climate change made flooding events in Asia stronger and more devastating.

Climate change is disproportionately affecting Asia. In April,the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the continent was hit hardest by climate change in 2023, with a total of 79 water hazard-related disasters that killed more than 2,000 people and directly affected 9 million people.

Rapid Urbanization Exacerbates Risks

Metropolitan centers like Kathmandu and Lalitpur were among the hardest hit. According to WWA, their geographic location, along a valley with few natural drainage points and in proximity of rivers, makes them highly vulnerable to flooding and landslides.

Rapid urbanisation and deforestation further exacerbated the Kathmandu Valley’s vulnerability to flooding. Buildings and infrastructure, which have increasedby 386%in only three decades, have replaced agricultural land, disrupting natural water processes and leading to higher likelihood of flooding. Soil erosion and sedimentation from widespread deforestation have also significantlyaffected the soil’s ability to absorb rainwater, increasing flood risk.

“Disasters are developmental problems as clearly seen in Nepal. It is high time to avoid disaster risk creation, focus on climate change adaptation and mitigation,” said Emmanuel Raju, director of the Copenhagen Centre for Disaster Research at the University of Copenhagen and one of the scientists behind the latest assessment. “Efforts must be made to avoid building in unsafe areas. Social protection investments are needed immediately to help with recovery and future disaster risk reduction,” he added.

Nepal is one of the countries in the world most vulnerable to climate change. International labour migration has become a strategy to secure funds to protect against the consequences of climate change, but for women it is not so simple.

Women living in poverty are widely assumed to be particularly vulnerable to environmental risks and climate change. In Nepal, the rising number of men migrating across borders to find work, leaving women with all the care and household responsibilities, is considered to be one of the main factors contributing to this climate vulnerability for women. However, the links between migration, climate change and gender are complex.

As one Nepalese woman, whose husband has been working in Saudi Arabia for the past five years explained, his migration meant that she had no one to take care of her and to share the burdens of daily life with. As a woman living without a husband, she was exposed to stigma from community members and her movement was constrained by strict gendered norms about where and when women can go without a male companion. She feared being alone at night and during weather disasters like floods, which were now common in the area, she was responsible for moving their family to a safe house. At the same time, his migration meant that she did not have to beg for money, and that she could feed their five children. She had used the remittances he sent monthly to secure their house from floods by raising it, and to buy a portable metal stove that she could use during floods when the clay stove on the ground was waterlogged. Her husband’s migration was therefore a source of new risks, but also a solution to a set of other challenges.

Key findingsBoth ‘everyday’ climate adaption, such as securing livelihoods, and long-term climate adaption, such as investing in and building robust houses, require funds. Labour migration contributes to financing both types.It is important to consider how climate change intersects with traditional and gendered dynamics, such as dowry. Crucially, due to traditional gender dynamics, men’s climate mobility can amplify women’s immobility.When men’s labour migration fails or the stream of remittances end, there are often no other ways for women to finance climate adaption. Therefore, alternative ways to finance long-term climate.

Key findings

Both ‘everyday’ climate adaption, such as securing livelihoods, and long-term climate adaption, such as investing in and building robust houses, require funds. Labour migration contributes to financing both types.

It is important to consider how climate change intersects with traditional and gendered dynamics, such as dowry. Crucially, due to traditional gender dynamics, men’s climate mobility can amplify women’s immobility.

When men’s labour migration fails or the stream of remittances end, there are often no other ways for women to finance climate adaption. Therefore, alternative ways to finance long-term climate.

Climate change, migration, and gender in Madhesh province

The study focused on Madhesh province in south-eastern Nepal, on the border with India. In this area floods and droughts are becoming increasingly frequent, and the unpredictable weather puts pressure on agriculture, a primary source of livelihood in the region.

This province exemplifies a complex web of gendered, socio-economic and environmental risk factors that require an intersectional lens. Newer research on how gender, environment and mobility influence one another has pushed the general understanding away from viewing climate change as the cause of migration but instead as a modifier that amplifies already existing dynamics and vulnerabilities.

Supporting existing research, our study also found that the vulnerabilities experienced by Madhesi Dalit women, at the bottom of Nepal’s class, caste and gender hierarchies,(1) are rooted in the complex ways that climate change intersects with traditional and gendered dynamics.

Climate change, migration, and women’s workThis brief is based on the pilot study ‘Climate change, migration and women’s work’, a collaboration between DIIS and the Danish Red Cross (DRC), with assistance from the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) and funded by the DRC.The study included a desk review of literature, reports, and statistics.Data collection and analysis were based on seven days of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with 19 women and 6 community stakeholders in the Dhanusha district of Madhesh province in Nepal.Based on the study, a short documentary called Somehow She is Managing has been produced.

The study included a desk review of literature, reports, and statistics.

Data collection and analysis were based on seven days of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with 19 women and 6 community stakeholders in the Dhanusha district of Madhesh province in Nepal.

Based on the study, a short documentary called Somehow She is Managing has been produced.

‘Everybody wants a brick house’

When asked what they would wish for, if they could ask for three things to help their situation, one woman replied: ‘a secure job, a water pump, and a brick house.’ The house she was currently living in was made of clay, mud and bamboo, and as she explained, ‘nobody wants to live in this house, everybody wants a brick house.’ Oftentimes the women we interviewed initially had very little to say about climate change as they did not understand themselves as being affected by such a global phenomenon.

As one woman said, ‘I don’t have any idea about climate change, but yeah, definitely something is changing. There is no rain at times, and everything is disturbed’. However, their wishes for the future often reflected the local and everyday realities of living under conditions of climate change, such as the growing need for a robust house, a steady income and access to water. Thus, any change in the climate is primarily understood through its consequences.

Madhesh provinceIn 2021/22 the majority of Nepalese international labour migrants with formal labour permits were from Madhesh. Top destinations are Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE.Despite this high number of migrant workers, Madhesh province has one of the lowest proportions of women migrants (only 4% of migrants from the region are women). This stark contrast is likely due to socio-economic conditions as well as strict gendered and cultural norms specific to the Madhesh region.It has the highest number of people living below the poverty line and the lowest Human Development Index (HDI) of all Nepalese provinces.Sources: Nepal Labour Migration Report 2022 (pp. 66–68); Nepal Multidimensional Poverty Index 2021.

One example is that the changing rain pattern is not seen as a problem in itself, but rather because agricultural day labour becomes scarcer. One woman explained that a recent drought had reduced the opportunities for work in the surrounding fields, which resulted in her ‘sleeping with hunger’ because she suddenly had no income.

Because these women rarely own land and rely on day-to-day labour, climate change was mainly experienced as a decline in work opportunities due to floods and droughts and thereby a deepening of poverty. The effects of climate change were felt as economic uncertainty, which resulted in fears about the future for themselves and their children.

Remittances and debt as climate ‘solutions’

Of the 19 women we interviewed, 15 had a husband and/or sons who were currently or had previously been abroad for work, most often in Malaysia, Qatar or India. They had all left due to a lack of work opportunities in Nepal. Remittances were therefore a critical source of income for these women and their families.

Remittances from labour migrants abroad have seen a steady increase in Nepal in recent decades. In 2020 and 2021, Nepal received more than EUR 7 billion in remittances.(2)

For Madhesi Dalit women, the remittances are on the one hand used to buy food and household supplies and on the other to build new and safer houses that can withstand floods. An older woman, whose son had worked in Qatar, explained, ‘we had a house of mud that used to get destroyed when the floods came, so we made this house with my son’s money’. As such, men’s international labour migration makes it possible for these families to invest in climate adaptation. Remittances were also crucial to managing debt. Of the women we spoke to, at least 11 were in debt and struggling to pay it off. They had usually taken loans from wealthier people in their communities to pay dowries for their daughters’ marriages, to finance their husbands’ or sons’ migration, to cover healthcare expenses, or simply to survive. In this way climate change not only created new expenses (such as new houses or metal stoves), but also made it more difficult to secure money for traditional expenses such as dowry payments.

Men’s mobility and women’s immobility

Among the 19 women, only one had migrated abroad. In all other cases the women felt that migration was not a possibility for them because of social and gendered expectations, the burden of their care responsibilities, lack of education and job opportunities, and their families’ debts. The women had very limited freedom of movement and often had to stay in the house unless accompanied by their mothers-in-law, with whom they often live. While families increasingly depend on the remittances from men’s migration due to fewer work opportunities at home, women experience increased immobility because they often cannot leave their houses when the men are gone.

Follow the moneyThe women in our study received approx. EUR 35–280 per month in remittances.Most women reported that they could make EUR 1–3 per day doing crop cultivation or household labour, if daily jobs were available.The loans held by the women in our study ranged from approx. EUR 1,400 to 5,600.Installing a water pump costs more than EUR 700, while borrowing someone.

Follow the money

The women in our study received approx. EUR 35–280 per month in remittances.

Most women reported that they could make EUR 1–3 per day doing crop cultivation or household labour, if daily jobs were available.

The loans held by the women in our study ranged from approx. EUR 1,400 to 5,600.

Installing a water pump costs more than EUR 700, while borrowing someone.

The role of debt in this dynamic is double-edged: on the one hand, taking loans enables the mobility of the husbands and sons. On the other hand, the burden of debt enhances the immobility of the women left behind. This was especially the case for women whose husbands or sons were injured, fell ill, or died during their work abroad. Between 2008 and 2022, 10,666 Nepalese migrant workers were reported dead, the majority of these in destinations in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.(3) Most of these deceased migrant workers came from Madhesh province.

Five of the nineteen women in our study had husbands or sons that had become ill, died, or disappeared abroad. In these tragic cases, the women could no longer rely on remittances and were also left to pay off the debt on their own. One woman whose husband had died working in India told us that everyone around her had husbands abroad who sent them money. She explained that ‘if my husband were still alive, then he would also have sent everything. I would have finished my loans and lived a better life.’

The everyday effects of climate change

Understanding and addressing the vulnerabilities experienced by Madhesi Dalit women, and other marginalised women exposed to climate risks, requires an intersectional perspective on the structural violence and discrimination that women experience in the form of immobility, stigma and isolation. This implies, for instance, that while migration and loans are often the only options for Madhesi Dalit women to manage climate-related challenges such as a lack of work and weather hazards, debt and men’s migration often expose these women to increased risks. Thus, in this context, climate change amplifies the already highly uneven patterns of mobility between men and women.

Abstract

Climate change and human activities are placing significant pressure on the carrying capacity of the Himalayan alpine ecosystem. This study focuses on seven transboundary protected areas and national parks in the Himalayas, including China’s Everest National Nature Reserve and Nepal’s Sagarmatha National Park, Manaslu Conservation Area, Langtang National Park, Gauri Sankar Conservation Area, Makalu Barun National Park, and Kanchenjunga Conservation Area. We used the Vulnerability Scoping Diagram (VSD) model to assess ecological vulnerability, analyzing land use changes and landscape patterns from 2000 to 2020 to identify key drivers of landscape changes. The fragmentation of ecological landscapes initially increased and then decreased, with values of 4.05, 3.99, and 3.86 observed, indicating a general reduction in regional ecological vulnerability. The south slope demonstrated lower ecological vulnerability than the north slope. Key factors influencing patch density included annual average temperature, population density, and annual precipitation. Annual precipitation, temperature, and the normalized vegetation index were the primary drivers of the largest patch index. The landscape shape index was most affected by precipitation, vegetation index, and slope, while the spread index was primarily influenced by precipitation and slope. The homogeneity index was most strongly related to annual precipitation, vegetation index, and normalized water index. This study provides a representative case for transboundary cooperation in ecological conservation, offering insights into sustainable development strategies for cross-border regions in the Himalayas.

Introduction

The ecological vulnerability of the Himalayan region has become a focal point of global concern due to the compounded effects of climate change, human activities (such as land-use changes, urbanization, and deforestation), and frequent natural disasters1,2. This region, characterized by its unique geology and ecology, is particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change3. Over the past decades, extreme weather events like heavy rainfall, droughts, and floods, along with geological hazards such as earthquakes and landslides, have severely affected local ecosystems4,5. Additionally, issues like glacial melt and river flow changes have further intensified ecological vulnerability. The accelerating climate change, marked by rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased extreme weather events, is exacerbating the region’s ecological fragility, threatening not only ecosystem stability but also water resources, agricultural productivity, and human livelihoods. Ecological vulnerability is closely linked to climatic factors but also influenced by geological, ecological, and socio-economic conditions6,7. Particularly in the Himalayas, increasing population pressure and the growing conflict between humans and natural resources are worsening the impact of human activities on the environment. Understanding the region’s ecological vulnerability and its driving forces is crucial for developing effective strategies for ecological conservation and adaptation in the face of ongoing global climate change8.

Land-use change is one of the most direct manifestations of human influence on the environment, impacting ecosystem types, spatial distribution, and driving changes in ecosystem services9. Landscape patterns, reflecting the spatial distribution of natural ecosystems, are shaped by both natural factors and human activities10,11. Changes in these patterns inevitably affect ecosystem quality and evolution12. With the increasing human impact, fragmentation of protected area landscapes is becoming a significant issue, leading to the degradation of ecosystem structure and function13. Analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of landscape patterns is vital for ensuring the sustainable development of protected habitats14. Despite the essential role of protected areas in preserving species and maintaining ecological processes, the combined effects of historical changes and overexploitation have resulted in ecological degradation in many areas. Recent studies on protected area landscapes focus on the dynamics of landscape pattern changes, their driving factors, optimization, and the simulation of landscape succession15. Methods like principal component analysis are useful for analyzing the impact of factors such as climate, hydrology, economy, and policy on landscape patterns, especially in large, complex protected areas. This research helps reveal the combined effects of natural and human factors, predict landscape trends, and provide guidance for the sustainable use of landscapes and biodiversity conservation16.

Compared to other mountainous regions, the ecological degradation in the Himalayas is more pronounced and continues to worsen17. Recent changes in the environment, driven by both climate change and human activity, have caused significant alterations in cross-border ecosystems, with problems such as glacial retreat, expansion of glacial lakes, and forest degradation becoming more severe18. In particular, the southern slopes of the Himalayas face increasing population pressure, land conflicts, and drastic changes in regional ecosystems, all of which threaten biodiversity and drastically reduce ecosystem service functions19,20. The growing risk of flood disasters, influenced by climate change and urbanization, has further intensified the region’s ecological degradation. Furthermore, climate change and hydrological disasters have had a marked impact on local monsoon crop patterns, directly exacerbating food security risks. While numerous studies on ecosystem vulnerability have been conducted, most focus on external disturbances, using models that assess exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity21. However, many studies overlook the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems and the interactions between various factors. Although global regression models and spatial analysis techniques have been applied in vulnerability studies, there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis regarding the spatial non-stationarity of climate and human activity factors22,23.

This study examines changes in landscape composition within the Himalayan cross-border protected areas from 2000 to 2020, comparing land-use changes and landscape patterns across these years and discussing the key driving factors behind these changes. Using Mount Everest as a case study, we developed an “exposure-sensitivity-resilience” ecological vulnerability assessment model and applied spatial principal component analysis to evaluate the region’s ecological vulnerability. The results highlight significant spatial-temporal differences between the northern and southern slopes of Mount Everest. By assessing ecological vulnerability, this study identifies critical areas of fragility, offering scientific support for targeted conservation and development strategies and providing references for the sustainable use of protected area resources.

Research area overview and data sources

Research area overview

The Himalayan Transboundary Protected Area (27°25′10″– 29°19′12″N, 84°26′51″– 88°22′11″E) is located on the border between the People’s Republic of China and Nepal, in the middle of the Himalayas on the southern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Fig.1). The region has been affected by strong tectonic movements that have created many world-class peaks, including six peaks above 8000 m, namely the world’s first peak Mount Qomolangma (8848.68 m), Mount Khangchendzonga (8586 m), Lhotse (8516 m), Makalu (8463 m), Cho Oyo (8201 m) and Shisha Pangma (8027 m)24. Due to the high altitude, steep terrain, strong ecosystem sensitivity, and weak resilience of the region, China and Nepal have successively established a series of nature reserves and national parks since the 1970s to protect fragile mountain ecosystems25. Qomolangma National Nature Preserve on the north slope of Mount Everest was established in 1988 and was classified as a national protected area in 1994, with a total area of 33,819 km2. On the southern slopes of Mount Everest, in the Himalayan region of northern Nepal, six nature reserves and national parks have been established from west to east, namely Manaslu Conservation Area, Langtang National Park, Gaurishankar Conservation Area, Sagarmatha National Park, Makalu Barun National Park and Kanchenjunga Conservation Area. The total area is 11,760 km2.

Location of study area. This original map was created by the author using ArcGIS v10.8 software (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/overview). Terrain data was processed through raster mosaicking, projection, mask extraction, and hill-shading to create the base map (https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1546314043-LPDAAC_ECS.html). Boundary information for China’s Qomolangma National Nature Preserve and Nepal’s Manaslu Conservation Area, Langtang National Park, Gaurishankar Conservation Area, Sagarmatha National Park, Makalu Barun National Park, and Kanchenjunga Conservation Area was sourced from Protected Planet (https://www.protectedplanet.net/en). Peak location data was obtained from OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.01/-95.84). These elements were then exported and refined in Adobe Illustrator (version 28.0) to overlay and label geographic names, producing the final map.

Data sources and processing

The data sources utilized in this research are detailed in Table1. The remote sensing image data of 2000, 2010 and 2020 are derived from the MODIS image data provided by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) website, with a resolution of 500 meters26. The GEE platform is currently the most advanced geographic big data analysis and visualization platform, which makes remote sensing monitoring of surface vegetation and water bodies break through the limitations of difficult data acquisition, large local storage, and low processing efficiency27. By running the input code, the MODIS image data can be loaded directly and effectively, the remote sensing data preprocessing and band calculation can be carried out, and the annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the annual average modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) in a large area can be obtained efficiently28. The meteorological data (temperature and precipitation) are derived from the CRU TS climate data set provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Sciences (NCAS) in the United Kingdom and are processed into raster data using the inverse distance weighting method. The population density data is derived from the WorldPop global population data set, the DEM data is derived from the US Geological Survey, the total primary productivity data of vegetation is derived from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and nighttime lighting data Obtain ‘NPP-like-VIIRS’ nighttime lighting data from the Harvard Dataverse platform. Due to the different sources and resolutions of the data, all the data are converted into raster data for projection conversion and resampling, and the spatial resolution is 0.5 km × 0.5 km29,30.

Research methods

Analysis of landscape pattern indices

The study area has rich patch types, a large number of patches, and high biodiversity, but it has the characteristics of strong ecological vulnerability. Referring to the FRAGSTATS guidelines and a large number of landscape pattern index studies (Table2), this paper selects five indicators: patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), contagion index (CONTA) and Shannon’s evenness index (SHEI) to analyze the current situation of landscape pattern in the study area, focusing on reflecting the current situation of landscape pattern in the ecologically fragile areas of the Himalayan cross-border region31,32.

Ecological vulnerability assessment model

This study assesses the ecological vulnerability of the northern and southern slopes of Mount Everest, considering both natural and anthropogenic disturbance factors33. Ecological vulnerability is evaluated through three main aspects: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Exposure is measured by population density and a comprehensive mountain hazard risk index, reflecting the external disturbances affecting the ecosystem. Sensitivity is captured by indicators related to climate, water, topography, and vegetation, such as temperature, precipitation, slope, water index (MNDWI), and vegetation index (NDVI). For adaptive capacity, net primary productivity (NPP) indicates ecosystem resilience, while the nighttime light index represents socio-economic development, indirectly reflecting local governments’ commitment to ecological protection (Fig.2).

Framework of the ecological vulnerability evaluation indicator system for the North and South Slopes of Mount Everest. This figure, created by the author using Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA), illustrates the framework for assessing ecological vulnerability in the Himalayas through the VSD model.

To ensure comparability across indicators, all data are standardized using the range standardization method. Indicators are classified as positive or negative based on their relationship with ecological vulnerability34. Positive indicators, such as population density, hazard risk, temperature, precipitation, and slope, correlate with higher vulnerability, while negative indicators, including water index, vegetation index, NPP, and nighttime light, reflect lower vulnerability35. This approach facilitates a comprehensive and consistent assessment of ecological vulnerability across the region36.

Positive Evaluation Indicators:\(\:{Y}_{ij}=\frac{{X}_{ij}-{X}_{min}}{{X}_{max}-{X}_{min}}\)

Negative Evaluation Indicators:\(\:{Y}_{ij}=\frac{{X}_{max}-{X}_{ij}}{{X}_{max}-{X}_{min}}\)

In this equation,\(\:{Y}_{ij}\)represents the normalized value of the\(\:i\)raster data for indicator\(\:j\)with a range of 0 to 1, while\(\:{X}_{ij}\)denotes the original value of the ithraster data for indicator\(\:j\).\(\:{X}_{max}\)and\(\:{X}_{min}\)are defined as the maximum and minimum values of the original data for indicator\(\:j\:\)at the\(\:i\)raster.

Ecological vulnerability results from the interaction of various factors. To identify the most significant influences on regional vulnerability, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to nine indicators in the ecological vulnerability assessment system37,38. PCA is a multivariate statistical technique that reduces complex data while retaining essential information39. Using ArcGIS, spatial PCA is performed, and based on a cumulative contribution rate exceeding 90%, the first four principal components are selected to represent the original nine variables. This data reduction simplifies the analysis while preserving key ecological insights (Table3).

This study assesses the ecological vulnerability of the northern and southern slopes of Mount Everest, focusing on the impacts of natural and human-induced disturbances. The evaluation relies on three core dimensions: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity40. Exposure measures external pressures on the ecosystem, combining indicators like population density and a risk index for mountain hazards41. These factors help gauge the extent of human activity and natural threats affecting the region. Sensitivity is assessed through four main environmental factors-climate, water, terrain, and vegetation42. Key indicators include average annual temperature, annual precipitation, slope, the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These metrics capture the ecological response to changes in climate, landscape, and water availability43. Adaptive capacity considers the ecosystem’s resilience and the region’s socio-economic development. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is used to measure the ecosystem’s self-regulation ability, while the nighttime light index reflects the area’s economic capacity to support ecological conservation. To ensure comparability across varied metrics, all data were standardized, distinguishing between factors that increase (e.g., population density) and decrease (e.g., NPP) vulnerability. A spatial principal component analysis was applied to synthesize these factors into a comprehensive ecological vulnerability index. This index reflects the overall ecological health and resilience of the Himalayan region, guiding targeted conservation efforts44,45.

The ecological vulnerability index (EVI) is defined as the weighted sum of m principal components, and the weight is expressed by the corresponding contribution rate of each principal component46. The specific equation is as follows:

In the formula,\(\:{X}_{i}\)is the\(\:i\)th principal component;\(\:{\sigma\:}_{i}\)is the corresponding contribution rate of the\(\:i\)th principal component;\(\:n\:\)is the number of selected principal components. The larger the value of EVI is, the higher the degree of ecological vulnerability is, and the ecosystem is vulnerable to damage. In contrast, a lower EVI value indicates a more stable ecosystem47. The calculation formula of the contribution rate is as follows:

In the formula,\(\:{\sigma\:}_{i}\)is the corresponding contribution rate of the\(\:i\)th principal component;\(\:{\lambda\:}_{i}\)is the eigenvalue of the\(\:i\)th principal component.

The standardization of the obtained EVI index can better solve the comparability of ecological vulnerability assessment results between different years, and can also analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of ecological vulnerability more clearly and intuitively. In this study, combined with the current situation of the ecological environment and the degree of ecological vulnerability of the Himalayan transboundary, the ecological vulnerability was divided into five levels by using the Jenks natural discontinuity point classification method, followed by slight (< 0.35), mild (0.35 ~ 0.55), moderate (0.55 ~ 0.72), severe (0.72 ~ 0.84) and extreme (> 0.84) vulnerability areas48. The comprehensive evaluation index of ecological vulnerability is constructed to express the comprehensive characteristics of ecological vulnerability, to express the overall ecological vulnerability state of the Himalaya transboundary by means of intuitive quantification. The equation is specified as follows:

In the formula,\(\:CEVI\)is the comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability,\(\:{T}_{i}\)is the value of the\(\:i\)vulnerability level,\(\:{A}_{i}\)is the area of the\(\:i\)vulnerability level area,\(\:S\)is the total area of the study area, and\(\:n\)is the number of vulnerability levels. By calculating the comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability, we can intuitively show the overall change trend of transboundary ecological vulnerability in the Himalayas, and can also compare the ecological vulnerability of each nature reserve49.

CATREG model

GATREG is a non-parametric multivariate regression analysis model that allows the analysis of categorical and numerical variables50. The classification regression (CATREG) selected in this study was analyzed, the discrete variables were selected and the pre-variables were selected into the regression. Category quantization refers to quantifying the category variables by a specific nonlinear transformation, and then iterating directly to find the optimal equation. The CATREG model is a classical linear regression model that applies and converts variables51. In the simple linear regression model, a response variable is predicted from the m predictors in x, trying to find a linear combination Xbthat has the greatest correlation with it. The optimal scaling involved makes the feasible nonlinear function analysis between Z and\(\:\sum\:_{j=1}^{m}\left({b}_{j}{\phi\:}_{j}\left({X}_{i}\right)\right)\). Its expression is as follows:

The categorical variable\(\:{h}_{j}\)defines the binary indicator matrix\(\:{G}_{j}\)of n rows and\(\:{l}_{j}\)columns, where\(\:{h}_{ij}\)defines\(\:{g}_{ir\left(j\right)}\)as follows:

where\(\:r\)=1, 2…\(\:{l}_{j}\), the run index, indicates the category number in\(\:\text{j}\). If the category quantification can be expressed in terms of\(\:{y}_{j}\), the transformed variable can be written as\(\:{G}_{j}{y}_{j}\), for example, the weighted sum of the predictor variables is expressed as:

This is the same as the standard linear model and GATREG is equivalent to a linear regression model which can be expressed as follows:

In the formula,\(\:{X}^{\text{*}}\)represents the coefficient matrix,\(\:{Z}^{\text{*}}\)is the observation vector,\(\:b\)is the normalized coefficient vector, and\(\:\epsilon\:\)is the error vector. In the optimal scaling process, the qualitative variables are transformed into quantitative variables. Categorical variables are quantified to reflect the characteristics of the original category, and nonlinear transformations allow the analysis of variables at various levels to find the best fitting model.

Results and analyses

Features of spatiotemporal changes in land use and landscape pattern

Change in land use from 2000 to 2020

By calculating the area and area proportion of different land use types in the Himalayan cross-border region from 2000 to 2020, this paper analyzes the interannual variation characteristics of land use in the study area during the past 20 years. The land use types include 8 types: Cropland, Forest, Shrub, Grassland, Water, Settlement, Naked land, and Glacier. At the same time, taking 10 years as a cycle, the study period is divided into two cycles, namely 2000–2010 and 2010–2020, to further analyze the characteristics of inter-annual changes in land use in the study area (Fig.3).

The distribution and change map of land use types in the study area from 2000 to 2020. This figure is an original creation by the author, developed using ArcGIS v 10.8 (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/overview) to analyze land use data from Global Land Analysis & Discovery (https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/GLCLUC2020). The process involved raster mosaicking, mask extraction, raster-to-vector conversion, and area calculations for various land types. Subsequently, we used Origin 2024 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA) to create a Sankey diagram illustrating land use trends from 2000 to 2020, and Adobe Illustrator Artwork 28.0 (Adobe Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) to finalize the composition.

The land use of the Himalayan transboundary area is mainly Naked land and Shurb, with about 68% of Naked Land in the northern and eastern alpine plateau regions, and about 10% of Shurb in the southern region. From the figure, it can be seen that about 1349.25 km2(2.94% of the total area) of land use types in the Himalayan transboundary area have changed. Overall, the bare land decreased by 266.59 km2, the shrub decreased by 99.33 km2, the construction land increased by 205.95 km2, and the water area increased by 92.56 km2. According to the specific analysis, the glacier transfer area is the largest, with a total of 566.34 km2transferred, mainly into bare land 512.00 km2(1.24%) and water area 10.23 km2(0.08%). The loss of glaciers is mainly distributed in the Himalayan transboundary area of Shisha Pangma, Khangchendzonga, and so on. This is followed by bare land, which turns mainly to water 114.33 km2(0.24%), mainly concentrated near glaciers. Shrubs are mainly converted to construction land 72.91 km2(0.16%), and forest is mainly converted to construction land 50.00 km2(0.11%), etc. In general, the land use types in the Himalayan transboundary area have changed, and the changes in bare land and construction land are more obvious. Glacier-Naked land, Naked land-Glacier or Water, Shrub-Settlement and Water- Naked land are the main types of land transformation in Himalayan transboundary areas.

Changes in landscape pattern from 2000 to 2020

Based on the theory and method of landscape pattern, using the landscape pattern analysis software FRAGSTAT 4.2, patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), contagion index (CONTA) and Shannon’s evenness index (SHEI) were selected to analyze the landscape pattern changes in the study area based on the land use distribution map of the Himalayan transboundary area in 2000, 2010 and 2020 (Fig.4).

Landscape pattern index of the study area from 2000 to 2020. The landscape pattern indices (PD, LPI, LSI, CONTAG, and SHEI) for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 were calculated using Fragstats 4.2–64 (http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/fragstats.html), the landscape pattern index formula is shown in Table2. The results were then mapped in ArcGIS v10.8 (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/overview) and refined using Adobe Illustrator Artwork 28.0 for final composition. It is mainly calculated from the data presented in the Table1.

From 2000 to 2010, the SHEI of land use landscape pattern in the study area decreased from 0.5027 to 0.4983, and the SHEI increased to 0.507 from 2010 to 2020, indicating that the fragmentation degree of land use landscape types in the Himalayan transboundary area increased first and then decreased with the complexity of landscape types. The increase in the PD for Settlement and Water in the eight land classes indicates an increase in fragmentation, while no significant change in the PD for the other land classes indicates little change in the degree of fragmentation. The CONTAG was 63.02 in 2000, increased to 63.28 in 2010, and decreased to 62.06 in 2020, when the maximum degree of aggregation of plaques increased first and then decreased. The LPI of the study area is low, where the index of bare land is much greater than the other land types, indicating the highest dominance of Naked land in the area. The LSI value of the shrub in the study area is the largest, indicating that the longer and irregular the patch boundary is the higher the degree of landscape fragmentation.

From a spatial and temporal point of view, the PD value increases from north to south, and the degree of landscape fragmentation on the southern slope of Everest is much higher than that on the northern slope. The LPI value is also gradually decreasing from north to south, that is, the dominant species in the landscape of the northern slope of Everest is bare land. There is a trend of increasing the LSI values from north to south, with the southern slopes showing a higher degree of landscape fragmentation than the northern slopes. The CONTAG value of the northern slope is higher than that of the southern slope, and the aggregation degree of the northern slope is higher. The SHEI values were higher on south slopes than on north slopes, and the patch types increase, or the proportion of each type of patch tends to be similar.

Features of spatiotemporal dynamics of ecological vulnerability

Spatiotemporal distribution characteristic of ecological vulnerability

The ecological vulnerability index of the study area was calculated based on the spatial principal component analysis model. After standardizing the index, the index is graded according to the established Himalayan transboundary ecological vulnerability grading standard, and the spatial and temporal distribution map of Himalayan transboundary ecological vulnerability is obtained (Fig.5). From the figure, it can be seen that the ecological vulnerability in the Himalayan transboundary study area is obviously different. The extremely fragile area of ecological vulnerability accounts for a high proportion and a large area is distributed on the northern slope. Especially in 2000, the extremely fragile area accounted for 55.13% of the total area of the study area. It can be seen that the ecological environment of the Himalayan transboundary protection area is easy to be destroyed, extremely sensitive to external interference, and difficult to recover itself. It is urgent to adjust and protect; the ecosystem of the southern slope is more stable than that of the northern slope. The slightly vulnerable areas and mildly vulnerable areas are widely distributed, and only a few areas are severely vulnerable areas and extremely vulnerable areas. Through the comparison of different years, it can be found that the extremely vulnerable areas are decreasing, especially in the eastern part of the northern slope of the study area, the extremely vulnerable areas are transformed into severely vulnerable areas, and gradually tend to integrate, indicating that the ecological environment of the Himalayan transboundary protected areas is getting better.

Dynamic change characteristics of ecological vulnerability

The dynamic changes of transboundary ecological vulnerability in the Himalayas are specifically analyzed as follows (Fig.5). From 2000 to 2010, the inflow area of the slight-vulnerable area and the mild-vulnerable area was greater than the outflow area, indicating that the trend of the high ecological vulnerability area flowing into the low ecological vulnerability area. It is found that the outflow area of moderate-vulnerable area, severe-vulnerable area and extreme-vulnerable area is large, especially the outflow area of extremely vulnerable area is 3281.25 km2, accounting for 23% of the area of extreme-vulnerable area in 2000. At the same time, the area flowing into the severe-vulnerable area is the largest, which is 3939.75 km2, and its main source is 662.25 km2flowing out of the moderate-vulnerable area and 3277.5 km2flowing out of the extreme-vulnerable area. From 2010 to 2020, the inflow areas of slight-vulnerable area, mild-vulnerable area and moderate-vulnerable area increased significantly compared with the previous period, flowing into 391.25 km2, 1296 km2and 1762.25 km2respectively, indicating that the trend of high ecological vulnerability areas flowing into low ecological vulnerability areas remained unchanged. The severe-vulnerable area and the extreme-vulnerable area showed a higher outflow area, which were 3157.5 km2and 3421 km2respectively, accounting for 33% and 15% of the severe vulnerable area and the extremely vulnerable area in 2010. Among them, the severe-vulnerable area mainly flows to the moderate-vulnerable area, accounting for 53% of the outflow area, and the extreme-vulnerable area mainly flows to the severe-vulnerable area, accounting for 99% of the outflow area. Meanwhile, the area transferred to the severe-vulnerable area is the largest, which is 3524.25 km2. Its main source is 123.25 km2transferred out of the moderate-vulnerable area and 3401 km2transferred out of the extreme-vulnerable area.

Changes in ecological vulnerability levels in the Himalayan transboundary area from 2000 to 2020. This figure was created by the author using ArcGIS v10.8 (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/overview). software to visualize indicators such as population density, mountain disaster risk index, climate, water environment, topography, vegetation, annual average temperature, annual precipitation, slope, modified normalized water index, and normalized vegetation index. Principal component analysis was conducted using the raster calculator, and the results were overlaid to produce ecological vulnerability maps for the Himalayan region for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. These maps were then compared to assess the index changes across the different years. Finally, the image was composed using Adobe Illustrator 28.0 (Adobe Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). It is mainly calculated from the data presented in the Table1.

Evaluation of comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability

The comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability in 2000, 2010, and 2020 was 4.05, 3.99, and 3.86, respectively (Fig.6). From 2000 to 2020, the overall ecological vulnerability of the Himalayan transboundary region showed a downward trend, and the ecosystem became more stable and healthier.

In 2000, 2010, and 2020, the mean value of the comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability on the northern slope was 4.51, while the mean value on the southern slope was 2.34. The comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability on the northern slope of Mount Qomolangma was significantly higher than that on the southern slope, so the overall ecological environment quality on the northern slope was significantly lower than that on the southern slope (Fig.7). Through the trend line, it can be clearly seen that the ecological vulnerability comprehensive index of the northern and southern slopes shows a downward trend, and the overall ecological environment situation tends to be stable and improved. By comparing the comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability of nature reserves and national parks across the Himalayas, the ecological vulnerability of nature reserves and national parks varies greatly. The comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability of nature reserves and national parks in 2020 is significantly lower than that in the previous two years. The ecological environment of nature reserves and national parks has been improved between 2000 and 2020. The average value of the comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability in the three years was calculated and sorted. The order from high to low was Qomolangma National Nature Preserve (4.51) > Sagarmatha National Park (3.12) > Manaslu Conservation Area (3.02) > Kanchenjunga Conservation Area (2.58) > Langtang National Park (2.28) > Makalu Barun National Park (1.78) > Gaurishankar Conservation Area (1.69). Among them, the average value of the comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability of Qomolangma National Nature Preserve is the largest, which is 4.51. The average value of the comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability in Gaurishankar Conservation Area is the smallest, which is 1.69. the largest average value of the southern slope of the study area appears in the Sagarmatha National Park, which is 3.12. As an important way to climb Everest from the southern slope, Sagarmatha National Park has always been a tourist attraction for climbers and tourists. It has been disturbed more frequently and its ecological vulnerability is relatively high. Among them, the average value of the comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability of Mount Qomolangma Nature Reserve is the largest, which is 4.51. The average value of the comprehensive index of ecological vulnerability in Gaolisanka Nature Reserve is the smallest, which is 1.69. The largest average value of the southern slope of the study area appears in the Sagarmatha National Park, which is 3.12. As an important way to climb Everest from the southern slope, Sagarmatha National Park has always been a tourist attraction for climbers and tourists. It has been disturbed more frequently and its ecological vulnerability is relatively high.

The main factors affecting the distribution of landscape pattern

On the basis of the significance test, the measurement of its relative importance is helpful to explain the contribution value of CATREG model to regression. The R2value of the fitting model was between 0.002 and 0.557, and all the fitting models passed the F test (P< 0.05), which was statistically significant. The tolerance of all variables is high enough to ensure that multicollinearity problems are excluded. For the same landscape index, the regression coefficients and significance of different influencing factors are different. On the basis of significance test, the relative importance measure is helpful to explain the contribution value of CATREG model to regression (Table4). Compared with other important values, Tmp (0.38), Worldpop (0.28), Pre (0.24), and NDVI (0.18) are the main factors affecting PD. The importance of Tmp shows a downward trend, while the importance of pre-shows an upward trend. Pre (0.43), Tmp (0.26), and NDVI (0.26) were the main factors affecting LPI. The importance of pre increased first and then decreased, the importance of NDVI decreased, and the importance of MNDWI decreased first and then increased.

Conclusions and discussions

Conclusions

Under the pressures of global climate change and socio-economic challenges, the transboundary regions of the Himalayas are experiencing increasing ecological vulnerability, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of driving factors for effective conservation strategies. This study examines ecological landscape changes from 2000 to 2020 in these regions, focusing on spatial and temporal patterns of vulnerability. The findings show that land use has shifted due to the reduction of glacial cover and the expansion of barren land, exacerbated by global warming and increased moisture. Landscape fragmentation increased initially but decreased over time, with barren land dominating the landscape, particularly on the northern slope of Mount Everest, which exhibited lower fragmentation than the southern slope. Ecological vulnerability has generally decreased over the past two decades, with the proportion of highly vulnerable areas decreasing by 9.83%, while the share of less vulnerable areas increased. The composite ecological vulnerability index dropped from 4.05 in 2000 to 3.86 in 2020, indicating overall ecological improvement. Spatially, the southern slope has lower ecological vulnerability than the northern slope, with 59% of the southern slope categorized as mildly or moderately vulnerable in 2020, compared to 60% of the northern slope being extremely vulnerable. Vulnerability hotspots have shifted, with increasing vulnerability observed at the boundaries of protected areas, especially between Sagarmatha National Park and the Everest Natural Reserve. The average ecological vulnerability index for 2000–2020 showed significant improvement across all protected areas, with the highest index in the Everest Natural Reserve (4.51) and the lowest in the Gauri Sankar Conservation Area (1.69). Analysis using the GATREG model identified key drivers of landscape metrics, including annual temperature, population density, and precipitation, which influenced patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), contagion (CONTAG), and the Shannon entropy index (SHEI).

Discussions

This study analyzes landscape changes and ecological vulnerability in the transboundary region of the Himalayas from 2000 to 2020. Over this period, climate change and human activities have caused significant land-use shifts, including reduced glacier cover, increased bare land, and tree line shifts, resulting in the migration of alpine vegetation and biodiversity, particularly above 2000 m. The northern slope of Mount Everest is more ecologically vulnerable than the southern slope, mainly due to drier conditions and insufficient precipitation hindering ecological recovery. Despite these challenges, the overall ecological environment of the Everest region shows signs of stability. This study is the first to use the VSD model and landscape pattern driving force analysis to assess ecological vulnerability in this region and identify key driving factors, with the goal of promoting sustainable development in cross-border areas.

(1)Ecological vulnerability in the Himalayas

Ecological vulnerability in the Himalayas

The Everest region and the broader Himalayan area face significant ecological vulnerability due to the dual impacts of global climate change and human activities. These factors exacerbate environmental issues, testing the resilience and capacity of the ecosystem. Understanding how climate change and human interventions affect ecological vulnerability is complex, as it involves not only the adaptability of ecosystems but also challenges for mountain communities, which manifest differently across various temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, ecosystems above 2000 m exhibit heightened vulnerability, with land use, topography, meteorological conditions, and soil moisture as key contributing factors52. Climate change has significantly impacted flagship species’ habitats, leading to habitat compression and altered geographic distributions53. Notably, land use changes have profound implications for species, with projections suggesting that approximately 30% of snow leopard habitats may disappear due to rising tree lines and shrinking high-altitude areas54. In Langtang National Park, climate change has markedly affected the cryosphere, impacting both local ecosystems and community livelihoods55. Despite these challenges, findings from this study indicate a trend toward decreased ecological vulnerability in the Everest region at the landscape level, suggesting that the ecological environment is stabilizing and improving.

(2)Landscape pattern evolution and sustainable development

Landscape pattern evolution and sustainable development

This study highlights the similarities and differences in landscape fragmentation and ecosystem vulnerability within the Himalayan region. Research demonstrates that landscape fragmentation exhibits complex dynamics across various temporal and spatial scales, aligning with our finding that fragmentation initially increases before decreasing56,57. Notably, fragmentation of built-up areas and water bodies has risen, while bare land remains the dominant land cover, complementing previous work on land use patterns and ecosystem dynamics58. Additionally, we observed that shrubland is the most fragmented, with irregular and significantly fragmented patch boundaries, echoing Sharma on the impact of forest fragmentation on biodiversity59. Our analysis reveals that the southern slope of Everest experiences greater landscape fragmentation than the northern slope, with increased complexity in the south, which contrasts with the dominance of bare land in the north. This regional disparity offers new insights, highlighting the varied impacts of human activities and climatic conditions on landscape structure60. The findings indicate that changes in landscape structure are significantly influenced by human activity and climate change, with different landscape types exhibiting varying levels of vulnerability and diversity, providing a scientific basis for future landscape management policies. Landscape fragmentation and land use changes pose threats to ecosystems and sustainable development, particularly due to the expansion of built-up areas and increased bare land, which negatively affect biodiversity and ecological functions. The differences in landscape complexity between the southern and northern slopes emphasize the need for regionally tailored management that accounts for ecological heterogeneity. Fragmentation leads to habitat isolation, compromising ecological connectivity and ecosystem services. Therefore, enhancing ecological corridors, vegetation restoration, and sustainable agriculture is essential to mitigate fragmentation impacts on vulnerable ecosystems. International cooperation is crucial for addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development in this region.

(3)The future of protected areas in the Himalayas

The future of protected areas in the Himalayas

The Himalayan region is home to 55 national parks and nature reserves, with 49 located within 100 km of international borders61. These transboundary protected areas are crucial for conserving cross-border species, promoting sustainable development, and enhancing peaceful cooperation62. Focusing on the example of Nepal and China, both nations prioritize ecological protection and sustainable development in the Everest region, establishing various parks and implementing environmental policies to foster innovative conservation models. In 1973, Nepal enacted the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, establishing the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation to regulate activities such as overgrazing, deforestation, and wildlife poaching within protected areas. In 1988, China established the Mount Everest Nature Reserve, and in 2018, it implemented management regulations to enhance biodiversity protection and resource management, strengthening the capabilities of conservation authorities. Additionally, in 2020, Nepal introduced a ban on plastic products under 30 microns thick in specific areas to improve the ecological environment. Looking ahead, the two countries plan to merge Sagarmatha National Park and Mount Everest National Park, creating the world’s highest international peace park, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 17, which emphasizes the importance of international cooperation for sustainable development63,64.

Health Heroes of the Himalayas: Vaccine Delivery on the Roof of the World

Video posted March 25, 2025 byGavi, the Vaccine Alliance

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, recently showcased the remarkable dedication of healthcare workers in one of the world’s most challenging terrains. Their documentary “Health Heroes of the Himalayas” highlights the critical work being done in Mustang, Nepal, where devoted health workers navigate extreme conditions to ensure children receive life-saving vaccines.

About Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance

Founded in 2000, Gavi helps vaccinate more than half the world’s children against deadly and debilitating infectious diseases. The organization has helped vaccinate over 1.1 billion children in 78 lower-income countries, preventing more than 18.8 million future deaths. Working through a powerful partnership model that includes the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, and the Gates Foundation, Gavi negotiates affordable vaccine prices for the poorest countries while removing commercial risks that previously kept manufacturers from serving these regions.

Their impact extends beyond immediate health benefits: for every US$1 spent on immunization in Gavi-supported countries, US$21 are saved in healthcare costs, lost wages, and lost productivity. When considering the broader societal value of lives saved and improved health, this return increases to US$54 per US$1 invested.

Now, let’s hear the stories from Mustang, Nepal, where Gavi’s mission meets some of the world’s most challenging terrain.

Mustang, Nepal: Facing Climate Change and Healthcare Challenges

In Mustang, the terrain is complex and the population is sparse. Health workers face numerous challenges, including the inability to stay in high-altitude areas for extended periods.

“Our health workers go to every home in our municipality,” explains a local official. “They bring vaccines and travel through all situations to vaccinate the children.”

The region faces pressing concerns: “It’s time to think about climate change. It’s time to think about children. It’s time to think differently about health workers.”

A Local Perspective

“My name is Chikme Gurung. I was born here. My grandmother, my father, my mother—everyone has lived here for generations,” shares a resident. “Mustang and every Himalayan part of Nepal holds Tibetan cultures. Though we have Nepali citizenship, we depend on Tibetan cultures.”

Chikme explains how climate change is affecting the region: “We can see many things changing in Mustang regarding the climate. Everything is becoming warmer and warmer. These days, we are not cultivating even a single field for wheat or barley, which Mustang has grown for generations. We have abandoned traditional farming and now only cultivate some trees like apple trees.”

The demographic changes are equally concerning: “It’s very hard. In this village, 95% of people my age, my childhood friends, they are abroad. In the past 10 years, not a single person has come back.”

Health Challenges in a Changing Climate

A healthcare professional explains: “In the high mountain region, there is a clear association between climate change and the expansion of vector-borne diseases like dengue. The transmitter of dengue is mosquitoes. Mustang was once a cold place, but nowadays, because of climate change and temperature increases, mosquitoes are moving upward. Our neighboring municipality has found dengue cases, and mosquitoes are now found here.”

“Since we cannot provide vaccines against climate change itself, we need investment for the prevention and control of these climate-sensitive diseases. One option could be the vaccine against dengue fever. There should be free distribution of vaccines to poor countries that are least responsible for causing climate change.”

Dedicated Healthcare Workers

“I’m grateful for my people and my health staff,” says a local health official. “We are thankful for our work. We will vaccinate children—it’s our responsibility. We go to every home in our municipality. During monsoon season, we face floods. Though it’s summer now, we also face strong winds. In winter, we work in temperatures of minus 20 to minus 30 degrees. Our services are needed in every situation.”

The commitment of these healthcare workers represents hope for the community as they navigate the complex challenges of climate change in this remote Himalayan region—a powerful example of Gavi’s mission in action, bringing life-saving vaccines to the world’s most vulnerable children, no matter how difficult the journey.

December 17, 2024

KATHMANDU– The optimism we’ve employed in every climate Conference of Parties (CoP) over the last decade following the Paris Agreement to cut global carbon emissions by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030 has only dwindled and proven naive. While we call out the big emitters for failing to meet their mitigation obligations, the spine-chilling frequency and ferocity of floods, landslides and droughts in the last decade have increased unabated, with some scientists even warning thatwe are heading for dangersnot seen in the last 10,000 years of human civilisation.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Nepal meets its national climate goals of achieving net zero before the 2045 deadline and implements the adaptation activities spelt out in our national plans. Will we be shielded from the growing menace of such disasters in a world that continues to set new climate records every year? The answer is probably a big, resounding no.

Whilespeaking at CoP29 in Baku last month, the former US Vice President, Al Gore, succinctly stated, “Some of the load-bearing elements of our entire earth ecological system are at risk” due to the relentless rise in global carbon emissions. We are to witness the consequences of these perpetually rising emissions on multiple fronts, from infrastructure to water and biodiversity to productivity. Perhaps its impact on agriculture has hurt civilians and communities the most. Starting from the global food crisis of2008, we have been paying noticeably more for food each year. Certainly, there are multiple reasons for the higher food costs, but a closer look points to climate change being at the issue’s core. These climate impacts have entered our kitchens, weakening the family economy and subsequently affecting public health and nutrition—hitting the poorest sections of society the hardest.

Rising food price

The implications of climate impacts on our agriculture are unfolding incredibly. A cursory comparison of vegetable prices over the years exemplifies how we pay more as climate impacts intensify. For example, the cost of cauliflower, a popular and common winter vegetable, wasRs45 per kg in November last year, while its price in the same period this year hovered around Rs150 per kg. The prices of other vegetables remain equally high.

The price hike is believed to be due to thedevastating floods and landslides of late Septemberthat damaged crops. Traders inKathmandu’s vegetable market incurred a huge losswhen their stock of vegetables was buried knee-deep under loads of silt twice this year.

When landslides and floodsdisrupttransportation, as we saw during the September floods, farmers suffer losses as vegetables go bad quickly without proper refrigeration, raising market prices. Consequently, most vegetables have been out of reach for consumers, especially those with fixed incomes, such as pensioners, daily wage workers, service holders and so on.

The price of imported food also shoots up when floods or droughts affect crops in the countries we import food from. One may recall that onion prices increased fourfold whenIndia banned itsexports following the loss of onion crops due to continued rain until late September 2019.

Climate stresses on agriculture

The rainfall distribution in recent years has become skewed, bringing heavy rain for a short period, usually concentrated in small areas—most of which flows out as runoff, leading to debris flows and landslides that often bury or destroy farms in the hills, rendering them beyond reclamation. Once destroyed, farmers are unable to reclaim the damaged land to bring it back to production. Similarly, floods in the plains damage standing crops and deposit sand and silt on the fertile land.

When most of the rain flows out as runoff, it leads to groundwater depletion, an unfortunate condition that results in a slow-buildingpressure on food production. Adding to these woes are frequent droughts, which have been identified asthe foremost factoraffecting farming.

Furthermore, there are subtle impacts on other areas. Degradation of soil water, soil chemistry and soil microbiomes caused by rising temperatures and extended droughts have deteriorated soil health. Moreover, we’re compelled to over-harvest nutrients to maintain production. We don’t know to what extent the soil health of our farms has degraded over the decades.

When farm incomes dwindle, it becomes beneficial for those in the sector to move on to other occupations like foreign labour. The psychosocial stresses caused by continued weather-related worries, which invariably start with water, force farmers to opt for the only logical choice—abandoning farming. According to areport published in 2020, a staggering 37 percent of the cultivated farmland in Nepal has been deserted. The figure must have increased significantly since floods, droughts and other agricultural plights like pests and crop diseases have intensified recently.

Enough of alarms

The challenges facing agriculture are born of years of policy failures, further exacerbated by climate change with far-reaching ripples that have continued and become too complex to rely on ad hocery. The changes in temperature, water regime and the subsequent changes in other spheres of the soil and their constituents have altered the existing environment, significantly impacting the agriculture system on all possible fronts. Hence, making agriculture climate resilient without addressing diverse climate-induced issues is unimaginable; unfortunately, many of these issues don’t fall within the ambit of our agricultural institutions.

How the agriculture sector addresses these changes will determine the state of our food security in the coming years. Otherwise, our food import bill will swell beyond a point that will make it hard for most of the lower middle class and the poor to afford adequate and nutritious food. The worst may come when food exports are restricted due to crop failure in the countries we import food from. Arecent study in Pakistanwarned that almost half of the country’s population could face food insecurity by 2030, a terrible blow to the global agenda of zero hunger set for the same year. Our situation isn’t much different, and we cannot afford to remain complacent. We must invest our limited climate-focused time in exploring all possibilities to safeguard food security by keeping our production base intact.

Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, an infectious disease expert at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) in Kathmandu, says he felt “helpless” when a sudden tsunami of patients with high-grade fevers, headaches and body aches descended on the hospital’s outpatient department in 2022.

In a normal times, they expected a daily influx of between 70 and 100 patients. But when thedengue outbreakbegan, that figure spiked to approximately 1,000 per day.

With the available human and other physical resources of the hospital, it was almost impossible to manage a surge of nearly ten times the capacity of the health institution. With the indoor spaces crammed, doctors and nurses began providing outpatient services on the open ground outside the hospital, Dr Pun remembers. Working hours stretched late into the evening.

The hospital’s inpatient department was also running out of capacity. Intensive care beds were full, and patients in the general ward were encamped on mats on the floor.

“With the indoor spaces crammed, doctors and nurses began providing outpatient services on the open ground outside the hospital.”- Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, an infectious disease expert at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) in Kathmandu

“With the indoor spaces crammed, doctors and nurses began providing outpatient services on the open ground outside the hospital.”

Private hospitals in the city were faring little better. Dr Bishad Dahal, now a third year internal medicine resident at Kathmandu Medical College, had just joined his residency in 2022 when dengue swept through the Kathmandu valley. He remembers going to hospital at 05:00 to look after admitted dengue patients, completing his rounds at 09:00 – then pitching in at the outpatient department to look after other suspected dengue cases until 17:00. Next, his rounds of admitted patients would recommence. Until the winter season began, and the caseload began to go into decline, his workday ended, between 21:00 and 22:00, he said.

For Nepal’s health care workers, the hard memories of the 2022 epidemic are reawakened each monsoon: the country has seen large-scale dengue outbreaks in the rainy season of each year since.

Dengue in Nepal: when it started, how it is going

The first case of dengue infection in Nepal was reported in 2004. A Japanese traveller had come to Nepal for a vacation, and is thought to have ‘imported’ the mosquito-transmitted virus after contracting it in India.

Two years later in 2006, 32 cases were reported in Chitwan district, in what qualified as the country’s first indigenous outbreak.

For a few years after that, dengue in Nepal was recorded, which is low-lying and shares a border with India.

According to reports released by Nepal’s Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD), Nepal faced its first-ever major outbreak in 2010, with 917 cases and 5 deaths.

The next big surge of dengue cases happened in 2013. By this time, the infection had spread to 25 different districts of Nepal. TheAedes aegyptimosquito that transmits the virus is more common in tropical and subtropical climates,  but as temperature norms shifted,dengue began to be reportedeven from the hilly and mountainous parts of the Himalayan country.

Until 2022,  major outbreaks occurred every two to three years. But since 2022 the country is facing an annual, seasonal rapid surge of dengue cases – a mounting concern for the health care system.

Every year, a new challenge

In arecent op-edpublished in the Kathmandu Post, Dr Pun wrote that “the virus has become more complex and dangerous” over the years. But it’s also hard to predict the virus’s course.

Though the pace of transmission has broadly accelerated in recent years, that hasn’t translated directly to higher year-on-year mortality rates.

Back in 2022, when a total of 54,784 cases were reported, the number of patients requiring ICU and hospital admission was very high. And the highest number of fatalities to date – 88 deaths – were reported that year.

In recent months, Nepal has been hit by some of the most devastating and widespread floods and landslides in its history.

In recent months, Nepal has been hit by some of the most devastating and widespread floods and landslides in its history.

This year when dengue infections started rising, hospitals also started preparing themselves, anticipating more severe dengue cases asreinfection with a different serotype is typically more dangerousthan the first.

But both epidemiologists and clinicians have been surprised to find that, even as the number of cases increases, the proportion of people getting severe infection is falling. Dr Sher Bahadur Pun has termed this year’s dengue wave ‘walking dengue’, as a majority of patients appear to be recovering without needing hospital admission.

That said, as of 28 October,12 verified dengue deathshad already been tallied, with the year’s surge expected to ebb away only in December.

When it rains, it pours

With researchers – and the World Health Organization – specifying alink to climate change, dengue is not a standalone challenge.

In recent months, Nepal has been hit by some of the mostdevastating and widespread floods and landslidesin its history.  The cause was massive rainfall. Once the rain stopped, and the affected communities began to recover and rebuild, the illness took hold.

Ujjwal Timilsina, a 17-year-old student living in Kathmandu to pursue his higher studies, initially had very high-grade fever, measuring 39.4°C. His spiking temperature came with a severe headache and pain behind the eyes.

Then, one after another, all his housemates came down with similar symptoms. Timilsina had had dengue a year previously, so he recognised his symptoms quickly. He took paracetamol and resolved to wait it out.

But after two days, he was admitted to hospital with intractable vomiting, difficulty breathing and bleeding from his nose. Many people in his locality – which was affected by last month’sfloods– have had similar symptoms.

Although dengue can take unexpected turns, the broad pattern is predictable. The monsoon season runs from June to August, and shortly after that, the dengue cases begin to surge. This is likely connected to the fact that the vector mosquitoes breed in waterlogged ditches and pools.

The spread of infection has also been more pronounced in urban areas and major cities like Kathmandu, Biratnagar, Chitwan and Pokhara, than in the rural part of the country.

Battle against the virus

But it isn’t only the virus that’s evolving.Each year, Nepal is better equipped to brace for the oncoming surge. Dr Gokarna Dahal, Section Chief, Vector Borne Disease Control Section, EDCD, toldVaccinesWork, “learning from past mistakes, this year we have prepared well, and more timely than before.”

An extensive “mosquito search and destruction” programme has been conducted across many local government zones. Health care institutions have been well prepared, stocking up on medicines and rapid diagnostic kits, with staff undergoing top-up training during the pre-monsoon period.

The primary goal is to prevent people from getting infected. But in case they become ill, this time the government is well prepared to handle the outbreak, says Dr Dahal.

In Nepal, climate change threatens honey hunters' tradition

Climate change is threatening the global bee population and, by extension, the honey harvest. The threat is particularly visible among Nepal's honey hunters in the Himalayan mountains.

Dizzying heights

Dangling from a rock face near the community of Taap in the central Nepalese district of Lamjung, these men carefully cut through large honeycombs with a blade attached to a long pole. The honeycomb extract is also known as ""mad honey,"" for its intoxicating qualities that can cause hallucinations. But the tradition of the honey hunters, as they are known, is in danger.

Wild bees on the retreat

Studies show climate change is negatively affecting the populations of bees and flowers around the world. In Nepal, that effect is becoming clear: for generations, members of the Gurung community, a people of Tibetan descent, have been combing the steep Himalayan cliffs for honey. Their yield has decreased from year to year.

Keeping a close eye on colleagues

To protect themselves from the cliff honeybees, the men in the group wear a bakhu — a kind of scarf or poncho that the women in the village make from sheep's wool. ""There were about 35 hives last year. We barely have 15 now,"" one of the men told the Reuters news agency. Ten years ago, the men harvested around 600 kilograms (about 1,322 pounds) of honey; today, they can only manage 100 kilograms.

Dangerous job

The job isn't entirely without danger. Bamboo is cut into long, thin strips and made into ladders on which the honey hunters hang from dangerous heights. ""It is fraught with danger of falling,"" said Aita Prasad Gurung, 40. The hunters are also aware of the damage they cause to the bees who lose their home, including their supplies and offspring.

Ritual sacrifice

Before every hunting trip, the hunters perform a ritual lasting almost an hour to ask for protection. They ask for divine blessing and apologize for having to take something from the bees. To make amends, they sacrifice a rooster, for example, and also give eggs or rice as gifts.

Keeping the bees at bay

Smoke produced by burning leaves and small branches is intended to drive the bees away from their honeycomb (left). Even though the honey hunters are experienced and hardened, they still react sensitively to the stings of the bees.

Occupational risk

Bashanta Gurung, 18, has been stung. He collapsed after several bee stings and was moved to safety.  Although the honey hunters protect themselves with makeshift mesh hats or simply with coarse-meshed plastic bags over their heads, they don't have full beekeeping equipment.

Fragile life

Climate change is causing problems for the bees. Erratic weather conditions have interrupted the flowering season throughout Nepal over the past 10 years. ""Honeybees are very sensitive and susceptible to high and low temperatures, they die quite easily,"" said Sundar Tiwari, an entomology professor at Nepal's Agriculture and Forestry University.",title nepal climate change threatens honey hunter tradition dw published sat jun gmt source dw nepal climate change threatens honey hunter tradition climate change threatening global bee population extension honey harvest threat particularly visible among nepal honey hunter himalayan mountain dizzying height dangling rock face near community taap central nepalese district lamjung men carefully cut large honeycomb blade attached long pole honeycomb extract also known mad honey intoxicating quality cause hallucination tradition honey hunter known danger wild bee retreat study show climate change negatively affecting population bee flower around world nepal effect becoming clear generation member gurung community people tibetan descent combing steep himalayan cliff honey yield decreased year year keeping close eye colleague protect cliff honeybee men group wear bakhu kind scarf poncho woman village make sheep wool hive last year barely one men told reuters news agency ten year ago men harvested around kilogram pound honey today manage kilogram dangerous job job entirely without danger bamboo cut long thin strip made ladder honey hunter hang dangerous height fraught danger falling said aita prasad gurung hunter also aware damage cause bee lose home including supply offspring ritual sacrifice every hunting trip hunter perform ritual lasting almost hour ask protection ask divine blessing apologize take something bee make amends sacrifice rooster example also give egg rice gift keeping bee bay smoke produced burning leaf small branch intended drive bee away honeycomb left even though honey hunter experienced hardened still react sensitively sting bee occupational risk bashanta gurung stung collapsed several bee sting moved safety although honey hunter protect makeshift mesh hat simply coarse meshed plastic bag head full beekeeping equipment fragile life climate change causing problem bee erratic weather condition interrupted flowering season throughout nepal past year honeybee sensitive susceptible high low temperature die quite easily said sundar tiwari entomology professor nepal agriculture forestry university,Positive,0.009981203007518796,0.5017731829573935,"Nepal (GPE), 08 (CARDINAL), 2024 (DATE), 07:00:00 (TIME), GMT (ORG), Nepal (GPE), Nepal (PERSON), Himalayan (NORP), Taap (GPE), Nepalese (NORP), Lamjung (GPE), mad honey (WORK_OF_ART), Nepal (GPE), Gurung (PERSON), Tibetan (NORP), Himalayan (NORP), year (DATE), about 35 (CARDINAL), last year (DATE), 15 (CARDINAL), one (CARDINAL), Reuters (ORG), Ten years ago (DATE), around 600 kilograms (QUANTITY), about 1,322 pounds (MONEY), today (DATE), 100 kilograms (QUANTITY), Aita Prasad Gurung (PERSON), 40 (DATE), almost an hour (TIME), bay

Living with climate change

What did children and young people from across Nepal share at consultations organized by UNICEF on the impact of climate change on their lives and prospects?

Nepal: ""School is where we learn the most about climate change and how to fight it, yet because of climate change, we’re being deprived of our right to quality education,"" says Tara Prasad, 16, from Rupandehi District.

Tara was one of the participants at a UNICEF-led climate consultation held in Lumbini Province. In 2024, UNICEF, in partnership with Chay Ya Nepal – and with support from various youth networks working in climate action in Nepal - organized five such consultations in Sudurpaschim, Madhesh, Karnali, Lumbini and Koshi Provinces.These sessions gave children and youth a platform to voice their lived experiences and concerns about how climate change is disrupting their daily lives.

The sessions were also aimed at empowering young participants as climate advocates, helping them understand the crisis and the role they can play in shaping sustainable policies and actions.

For many participants, the impact of climate change on education emerged as a major concern. Tara, for example, shared how rising temperatures have made even short walks to school challenging.

“I am drenched in sweat by the time I get there,” he says. “The heat also makes it difficult to concentrate in class.”

Laxmi, 20, from Khotang, described the dangers students in her community face during heavy rains, when swollen rivers block their paths to school.

“We have to either risk our lives crossing the river or wait at school until the water levels go down,” she says. “It has impacted our lives and education.”

Forced migration due to climate-induced disasters was another recurring theme.

“Relocation was very tough for us. Adjusting to a new environment and finding opportunities was a challenge,” shares Simana, 22, from Rupandehi, on her own experience of having to move following such a disaster.

The mental health impacts of climate change were also brought to light. Ram, 18, from Rupandehi, recounted how a friend’s family, dependent on farming, lost their rice crop to heavy rain.

“The loss caused stress and conflict at home, which affected him mentally. He didn’t want to come to school and seemed sad all the time,” says Ram.

Ankita, 17, from Jhapa, spoke of the trauma of losing loved ones in floods, while Dipson, 15, from Morang, shared the story of a young man who lost his life trying to save a gas cylinder during a flood.

“Children and young people are traumatized by such experiences,” he says.

Discussions also highlighted the challenges faced by marginalized groups and people with disabilities.

“When safe spaces and disability-friendly infrastructure are destroyed by floods, it severely limits access to essential services,” says Pritam, 25, from Morang.

Udip, 20, also from Morang, highlighted the insufficient uptake of innovative technologies that could mitigate the impact of climate disasters.

Referring to the recent Thame glacier outburst, he says, “Preparedness actions could have been implemented if we had used digital technology.”

Participants were unanimous in their assertion that climate change is not just an environmental crisis but a child rights crisis. They urged that their voices to be heard, and their experiences considered when addressing climate change, since the decisions being made today will shape their future.

“Children and young people should be prioritized in discussions about climate change,"" emphasizes Bandana, 17, from Dhanusha.

Matrika, 16, from Kailali, adds, ""Mandatory representation of children in climate policies is essential.""

The insights shared during these consultations underscore the wide-ranging consequences of climate change — from disruptions to education to threats to mental health and well-being. Marginalized groups, including those with disabilities, are particularly vulnerable.

Through this initiative UNICEF aims to strengthen young people’s knowledge and skills on climate change and climate action, as well as ensuring their perspectives are reflected in child-friendly climate policies aligned with national and global efforts like the NDC and COP29.

""Children are our future,"" says Pinki, 21, from Parsa. ""Just as we care for young plants, we must invest in children today for a sustainable tomorrow.""

Manipur journalists learn climate change reporting techniques at ICIMOD Nepal

Manipur journalists participated in a climate change reporting training in Nepal. The program aimed to improve their skills in covering climate issues effectively

A group of 13 individuals from Manipur, including journalists and officials from the Directorate of Environment and Climate Change, visited the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Nepal on a media exposure trip aimed at enhancing their skills in effective climate change reporting.

The Directorate of Environment and Climate Change, Manipur, organised the exposure visit for journalists who had received a media fellowship on climate change reporting, conferred by the directorate. The Media Resource Centre of the directorate, comprising eminent editors and journalists, also collaborated in organising the visit.

Addressing the media, the Director of the Directorate of Environment and Climate Change, T. Brajakumar, stated that the purpose of the exposure visit to ICIMOD, held from May 1 to May 6, was to broaden understanding of climate change issues and improve the standard of reporting on the subject.

He emphasised that the media is one of the key stakeholders in combating the impacts of climate change. With this vision, the directorate has been encouraging journalists to report on climate issues by offering media fellowships since 2017. In addition, monthly seminars and interaction programs related to climate change have been regularly conducted for media personnel.

As part of this ongoing initiative, the directorate selected four media fellows for the exposure trip to ICIMOD, Nepal.

Expressing hope that the visit would generate new ideas and insights, Brajakumar said the team interacted with ICIMOD’s communication unit, where experts discussed ways to convey climate change issues in simple and accessible language.

The journalist team also had the opportunity to undertake field visits to several locations. One such site was Bhagwate Pukhako Kuwa, a critical spring located in Bhagwate Village, Namobuddha Municipality-2, Nepal. According to ICIMOD studies, the spring had been drying up due to rainfall variability, changes in intensity and duration, groundwater extraction through deep boring, and the abandonment of traditional ponds.

However, it has since been rejuvenated through ICIMOD’s intervention in partnership with the local government of Nepal. The team also visited Patan Durbar Square, where many springs once flowed but are now drying up due to various factors.

Brajakumar also highlighted the importance of cross-border learning and knowledge sharing to protect the planet from the adverse effects of climate change.

BACKGROUND AND TRENDS

Climate change induced extreme events coupled with environmental degradation are leading to more displacement and involuntary migration increasing global vulnerability (IPCC, 2022). Scholars note that environmental and climatic factors often interplay with social, political, and economic forces to influence migration patterns (Mpandeli et al., 2020). Migration is a multi-causal phenomenon which makes it difficult to identify the degree to which movements are driven by environmental factors (Flavell et al, 2020). However, increasing bodies of research have shown the link between migration, environment and climate change (Hunter and Nawrotzi 2016; and Piguet 2021).

A regional study conducted in 2016 in Nepal, Bangladesh and Maldives concluded that uncertainties caused by climate change impacts on livelihood options were influencing human mobility (IOM, 2017). Another study conducted in 2024 in Nepal also confirmed this trend and revealed that migration, livelihood diversification, uptake of alternative livelihoods, intensive farming and integrated water management were the most common measures being taken by people to cope with the environmental stressors associated with climate change, environmental degradation and disasters (IOM and GoN, 2024).

Weather related disaster events are a major cause for displacement in Nepal: Between 2011-2021, 3.4 million were displaced and 245 disaster events were recorded in Nepal (IDMC and ADB, 2022). The UNFCCC notes that the adverse impacts of disasters and climate change on human mobility can be averted or minimized if concerted actions are prescribed under international law (UNFCCC, 2019).

A significant gap in discussing the securitization of climate change-induced migration is the consideration of gender dimensions (Resureccion et al., 2020). Literature on gender and climate change often overlooks migration issues. Both the pressure to migrate and the ability to migrate vary by gender and other intersecting aspects (IOM, 2014).

Migration offers both opportunities and challenges. When migration is safe, regular and orderly, it can contribute to economic growth and cultural exchange, fulfil labor shortages and support climate change adaptation. However, forced migration and displacement should be avoided.",title migration environment climate change nexus nepal policy brief en ne reliefweb published wed apr gmt source reliefweb nepal migration environment climate change nexus nepal policy brief en ne iom attachment download report pdf kb english version download report pdf kb nepali version background trend climate change induced extreme event coupled environmental degradation leading displacement involuntary migration increasing global vulnerability ipcc scholar note environmental climatic factor often interplay social political economic force influence migration pattern mpandeli et al migration multi causal phenomenon make difficult identify degree movement driven environmental factor flavell et al however increasing body research shown link migration environment climate change hunter nawrotzi piguet regional study conducted nepal bangladesh maldives concluded uncertainty caused climate change impact livelihood option influencing human mobility iom another study conducted nepal also confirmed trend revealed migration livelihood diversification uptake alternative livelihood intensive farming integrated water management common measure taken people cope environmental stressor associated climate change environmental degradation disaster iom gon weather related disaster event major cause displacement nepal million displaced disaster event recorded nepal idmc adb unfccc note adverse impact disaster climate change human mobility averted minimized concerted action prescribed international law unfccc significant gap discussing securitization climate change induced migration consideration gender dimension resureccion et al literature gender climate change often overlook migration issue pressure migrate ability migrate vary gender intersecting aspect iom migration offer opportunity challenge migration safe regular orderly contribute economic growth cultural exchange fulfil labor shortage support climate change adaptation however forced migration displacement avoided,Positive,0.06233974358974359,0.3446252465483234,"Nepal (GPE), 30 (CARDINAL), 2025 (DATE), 00:25:17 (TIME), GMT (ORG), ReliefWeb

Nepal rains intensified by human-induced climate change: scientists

Several experts have underscored the urgent need to limit ‘development’ in low-lying, riverside as well as address activities that accelerate global warming

PTI

The late-September floods that killed more than 240 people in Nepal were driven by rainfall made about 10 per cent more intense by human-caused climate change, a rapid analysis by a team of leading scientists said on Thursday, 17 October.

An analysis by World Weather Attribution (WWA) also underscored the urgent need for Nepal to limit development in low-lying, riverside areas of Nepali cities to prevent and protect people from future floods.

WWA is a collaboration of international scientists that analyses and communicates the possible influence of climate change on extreme weather events, such as storms, extreme rainfall, heat waves and droughts.

The floods in Nepal followed three days of extreme rainfall starting 26 September. As records were broken across central and eastern Nepal, with some weather stations recording more than 320 mm on 28 September, massive floods and landslides claimed at least 244 lives and caused a heavy loss to the country.

‘Climate change was responsible for making the extreme three-day downpours in Nepal about 10 per cent more intense. Bursts of rainfall will become even more heavier, risking more destructive floods until the world replaces fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy,’ the WWA analysis said.

The flooding in Kathmandu valley was of an order never seen before in the past, according to eye-witnesses. More than 50 people were killed and properties worth billions of rupees were damaged due to the heavy rainfall that hit the capital city alone.

Highlighting how rapid development greatly worsened the impacts of the flood, the study noted that Kathmandu — the largest city in Nepal and amongst the hardest-hit districts for flooding — is built around the Bagmati river in a bowl-shaped valley and has experienced rapid growth in recent decades.

“Limiting development in flood-prone urban areas will reduce the number of people in harm’s way and save lives when floods occur in the future,” the researchers said, and also suggested scaling up of early warning systems and prompt action to avoid repeat flooding disasters.

The study was conducted by 20 researchers as part of the World Weather Attribution group, including scientists from universities and meteorological agencies in Nepal, India, Sweden, the United States and the United Kingdom, a WWA statement said.

“If the atmosphere wasn’t overloaded with fossil fuel emissions, these floods would have been less intense, less destructive and less deadly,” remarked Mariam Zachariah, researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College, London.

Further, this study also highlights “how vulnerable Asia is to increasing downpours — in 2024 alone, our studies have uncovered the fingerprint of climate change on deadly floods in India, China, Taiwan, the UAE, Oman, and now Nepal,” Zachariah pointed out.

“Clearly, climate change is no longer a distant threat in Asia,” said Roshan Jha, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. “With every fraction of a degree of warming, the atmosphere can potentially hold more moisture, leading to much heavier downpours, and catastrophic floods like these.”

What do you do when a gastrointestinal illness takes out half of your research team that traveled nearly 8,000 miles to Nepal to study the effects of climate change on Buddhist holy lakes?

You press on.

An interdisciplinary group of Carolina researchers first journeyed to Mount Everest’s Khumbu region in summer 2018, returned in fall 2019 and — after COVID delayed the original return plans — made the trek again to the Gokyo Lakes in summer 2022.

The team consists of mathematicians Rich McLaughlin and Roberto Camassa, marine scientists Harvey Seim and Emily Eidam and religious studies scholar Lauren Leve.

Leve was not able to make the trek to the lakes this year due to other research she was conducting in Nepal, but she laid important groundwork for the team’s journey by securing needed paperwork and permits. She has provided ongoing counsel and support on this high-altitude region that is sacred to the Buddhist tradition.

The Nepal summer 2022 team from left to right (with their guide making the peace sign in the background): Emily Eidam, Roberto Camassa, Rich McLaughlin and Harvey Seim.

“I can tell you my sad story,” began Seim, as he relayed his version of the trip. Altitude sickness, a common occurrence, had plagued the team on previous treks. But this time a new challenge cropped up.

“Emily and I were only in the mountains and on the trail for two days. It became pretty obvious that we had a GI bug — and as I was slowly getting better, she was getting worse,” said Seim, who has done research from North Carolina to the Galapagos. “Our contribution was largely to lead the field program, and we never prepared for this contingency. So Rich and Roberto continued on.”

The good news? Camassa and McLaughlin were able to successfully retrieve all 14 thermistors and pressure sensors that had been placed in fall 2019 in lake 4, one of six lakes, to measure lake temperature and pressure at different depths.

But it wasn’t easy.

McLaughlin was also battling the same GI bug and has ongoing knee problems, although braces, viscous gel injections and physical therapy before the trip helped some.

But this journey through the peaks and valleys of Sagarmatha National Park is not for the faint-hearted.

Once you get deep into the mountains, there are no vehicles, no roads. As Seim noted, “It’s people or animal power that moves everything — you are on the trails with hundreds of donkeys and yaks.” You can count on rain and snow and cloudy conditions.

The trails are steep and sometimes slippery and that alone “can be mentally taxing,” he said.

McLaughlin tallied up the total hiking distance at about 85 miles in two weeks, but that’s not the whole story.

“It’s the elevation rise and fall that’s challenging,” added McLaughlin, who is chair of the mathematics department. “You might climb up to 13,000 feet then down to 11,000 as the trail descends and you hop around rocks and cliffs. Then it’s back up again. The total ‘up’ is probably more like 20,000 feet.”

Adventures on the lake

Oh, the wind. And the cold. The water temperature in the lake is 5 to 6 degrees Celsius (about 41 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit), so you don’t want to fall in.

The watercraft used for research is an inflatable river raft that has to be packed up and hiked in. The nasty GI infection also hit one of the guides, who had to be helicoptered out of the region, so Camassa and McLaughlin were left with a less experienced paddler.

The first two days out on the lake did not go well. They were having trouble locating the previously deployed scientific instruments. They tried texting Seim and Eidam (who were recovering in Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital city), using Garmin inReach satellite communication devices, but the marine scientists were not getting the messages. The internet was down, so phone calls were also not going through.

On day three, Camassa and McLaughlin were able to connect with Seim via a brief phone call, although the signal was weak. The next day they vowed to try one last time on the water.

“Harvey suggested if all else fails sort of spiraling in against the wind, doing loops around the mooring while dragging the grappling hook to try to pull the thermistors out,” said Camassa, who is the Kenan Distinguished Professor of Mathematics and is on a Rothschild Visiting Professorship at the University of Cambridge this semester.

Success!

“It was like a Hail Mary, a last-second shot with our feet on the out-of-bounds line. We were exhausted and running out of time,” McLaughlin added. “The fact that we managed to pull the instruments out was kind of like …”

“Like hitting a three-pointer at the buzzer!” Camassa said, laughing, finishing his colleague’s sentence. “It was the best thing that we could have possibly hoped for.”

A rich dataset, troubling revelations

After retrieving the instruments, McLaughlin said the team now has about four years of continuous data from lake 4. The holy lakes lie next to the Ngozumba glacier, the largest glacier in Nepal. The researchers are trying to understand how glacial melting due to climate change is impacting the physical and biological properties of the lakes.

“We’re trying to assess what’s happening to the lake level if certain changes in climate continue,” McLaughlin said. “The data is pretty exciting, but it’s a little bit alarming, too. It’s showing this continued trend of more precipitation, and the lake level is rising as things are melting.

“You can really see the glacier retreating in this four-year window that we’ve been going there. Although we have not done a detailed analysis on this new data, what we can say is that we are gaining a comprehensive understanding of how that valley and the system of lakes work and how they are responding to a new influx of water.”

The team is in the process of submitting a journal paper based on data from the first two trips.

This year the mathematicians added a new tool — drone photogrammetry — to help build out a more complete picture of what’s happening. By flying the drone in a grid pattern over different areas, the scientists are able to stitch the images together to construct a three-dimensional model of the topography of the region. They captured drone footage on lakes 4 and 5.

Jaye Cable, a marine scientist and senior associate dean for natural sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences, has provided ongoing help to the team in analyzing water samples they have collected.

The team will continue to develop the story of the changes in this region.

“It’s rare to be able to capture this much detail with instruments collecting data basically every half hour,” Camassa said. “It’s an arduous journey for sure, but this is the only way to access this area of the world. And we think this will help our understanding of what’s going on with the broader picture of climate change.”

Doing research in far-flung places? Pack your patience

The onset of monsoon season and a fatal plane crash that happened in the region during the same time the team was in Nepal made the journey home challenging. There were multiple flight cancellations and delays. Some of the scientific equipment made its way back home on a separate flight.

Seim, a seasoned researcher, said packing your patience and flexibility is just par for the course in doing science anywhere in the field.

“Welcome the adventure, and don’t be dismayed if things don’t go exactly as planned. Often you can pull small victories out of what might initially feel like defeat,” he said. “Be adaptable.”

The researchers agreed this was their most challenging trip to Nepal yet. Seim, a former chair of marine sciences, praised the value that an interdisciplinary team has brought to this work.

“One of the joys that stuck with me from my time as chair was getting to know faculty members in different disciplines,” he said. “On this team, the math guys and I share an interest in fluid dynamics, so we’re not that far apart scientifically — but learning from Lauren has been like having a personal lecturer on all of the social, political and religious intersections happening in Nepal.”

And sometimes you just have to pause and take it all in to appreciate this stunning area of the world, Seim added.

“It was magnificent when the clouds parted, and you saw these spectacular views. At times, I was in absolute awe.”

The Chinese government’s failure to provide information about the state of its Himalayan glacial lakes is endangering mountain-dwellers in neighbouring flood-prone Nepal, according to a senior government official.

Two lakes in Nepal burst last Friday, destroying dozens of homes in a village known for its Everest sherpas, raising fears that global warming is likely to cause more such disasters as glaciers melt in high mountain ranges.

After last week’s flood, Jagadishwor Karmacharya, the head of Nepal’s hydrology and meteorology department, told Climate Home the Chinese government has not shared “essential” information about its glacial lakes and the risk of floods that threaten Nepal.

In 2016, for example,Gongbatongshacuo Lake in Tibetburst, causing a flood along the Bhote Koshi River in Nepal’s northern district of Sindhupalchowk. It swept away 20 houses, a boarding school and parts of a customs office, damaging dozens more buildings and a hydropower plant and destroying large stretches of road, including a highway linking Nepal and China.

Karmacharya said China, Nepal and India must collaborate to prevent such disasters, adding that Nepal has been asking China for many years to supply data about its glacial lakes but China has not met promises to do so made in bilateral meetings and other fora.

“If a lake in China bursts, the impact on Nepal could be unimaginable,” he said. “This information is essential for us to prepare and reduce the impact of floods.”

The Chinese embassy in Kathmandu did not respond to an emailed request for comment.

Melting ice

A glacial lake is made up of water from melted glacier ice. Climate change has sped up the melting of glaciers which forms lakes and can cause avalanches, making it more likely that the water in these lakes bursts through the ice holding it back, causing what is known as a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF).

That’s what happened last week in a relatively small pair of lakes called Para Chhumo in Nepal. According to University of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Amrit Thapa, warming air melted snow and glacier ice, causing an upper lake to form in the 2010s, adding to the lower lake which has existed since the 1980s.

Both lakes burst their banks on Friday, with water rushing 10 km down the mountain to hit the village of Thame, famous as the home of Sherpa mountaineers like Tenzing Norgay, where it destroyed 23 homes and damaged 40 more, according to the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality.

A bridge and tourist trails were also washed away and local business-owners told Climate Home they feared the tourist industry the village relies on will be hit, as there are fewer places for visitors and trekkers to stay.

Basanta Raj Adhikari, an engineering professor at Tribhuvan University and director of itsCentre for Disaster Studies, asked: “If a small glacial lake like this can cause such destruction, what would happen if a larger one bursts?”

A 2020 report from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in Nepalidentified 47 glacial lakesin the Himalayas as potentially dangerous. One, Tsho Rolpa, is 30 times bigger than Para Chhumo. Of these 47 glacial lakes, one is in India, 21 are in Nepal and 25 are in Tibet, which is governed by China.

Between 1977 and 2020, Nepal experienced 26 GLOFs, 14 of which originated in the country, the inventory noted.

Move the village?

To compensate local people for this month’s damage in Thame, the Nepali government has provided about $450 to each affected family and is preparing temporary accommodation.

Anil Pokhrel, head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, said the government is studying whether the area is suitable for continued settlement. “If it is not safe, we will relocate the village to a safer place,” he said.

Other measures that can be taken to protect people from GLOFs include lowering water levels in glacial lakes and installing community-based early warning and response systems, according to ICIMOD and UNDP.

In anongoing court casein Germany, a Peruvian farmer is suing energy giant RWE over the contributions its planet-heating fossil fuel emissions have allegedly made to the threat to his village from Lake Palcacocha in the Andes, which burst in the 1940s killing 2,000 people.

The local government is planning to build a new dam and drainage system at the lake to reduce the risk of flooding, at a projected cost of around $4 million, and the lawsuit argues that RWE should contribute funding of about $20,000 in line with its share of global emissions.

Whatever the outcome of this closely watched legal case, veteran Nepalese tourism entrepreneur Ang Tshiring Sherpa said climate change is already damaging Himalayan tourism, and Sherpa communities are bearing the burden.

“Those who have contributed the least to climate change are facing the worst consequences,” he said. “Climate change is not in some distant future; it is already happening. Why do our voices always fall on deaf ears? And how is it fair that our remote mountain communities have to fend for ourselves?”

Nepal is grappling with the aftermath of record floods that killed at least246 people, including 32 children. The late September floods also displaced more than10,000 householdsacross the nation’s capital, Kathmandu, and surrounding districts, and caused widespread damage to infrastructure.

The unprecedented rainfall on Sept. 28 was the heaviest ever recorded in Kathmandu, according to Nepal’s Hydrology and Meteorology Department.

Rescue teams continue to search for the missing as people work to restore their communities and reestablish essential services. “Across the country, people are busy clearing debris from floods and landslides while major highways remain disrupted,” Manjeet Dhakal, the Kathmandu-based South Asia director at Climate Analytics, told Mongabay in an email.

Torrential monsoon rains of more than 200 millimeters (8 inches) triggered landslides and caused rivers, including the Saptakoshi, Nepal’s largest, to burst their banks at levels not seen in more than 50 years.

Initialassessmentsof the damage put the cost at 13.4 billion rupees ($100 million).

More than 40 bridges were either fully or partially destroyed. Nearly 100 schools were shut down and 95,000 hectares (235,000 acres) of farmland, an area roughly 10 times the size of Paris, was ruined.

Eleven hydropower plants were severely damaged, raising further concerns over the country’s fragile energy infrastructure and overreliance on hydropower. For Dhakal, this presents an opportunity to invest in energy diversification via other renewable sources.

Nepal is responsible for just0.1%of global greenhouse gas emissions but is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts.

Roughly 10% of Nepal’s urban populationlive in informalsettlements on riverbanks. They’re often hit the hardest by the floods, many working-class families lose their jobs and belongings in these climate-related events.

More than 1.9 million Nepalese citizens, or 7% of the total population, are consideredhighly vulnerableto climate change, according to a 2010 assessment.

“Every degree of global warming is projected to cause an exponential increase in extreme daily rainfall,” Dhakal said, raising concerns about the nation’s poor urban planning, which he said likely exacerbated the impact of the floods.

“Nepal must invest in early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, and sustainable urban and rural planning. At the domestic level, political will is essential for both immediate responses and long-term recovery,” he added.

Nepal - Country Climate and Development Report

As temperatures rise across South Asia, climate and disaster risks in Nepal are expected to increase further, affecting people, the economy, the environment, and development gains. Nepal’s temperature is projected to increase by about 0.9 C between 2016 and 2045 under a medium-range emissions pathway. Winters are projected to be drier and monsoon summers wetter, with up to a threefold increase in rainfall. The number of people in Nepal annually affected by river flooding caused by climate change could double to around 350,000 in 2030 (from 157,000 in 2010).

While Nepal has low per capita emissions and is a negligible contributor to global climate change, agricultural and energy-related emissions are also a key source of air pollution, with major negative economic implications. Emissions come primarily from agriculture (54 percent) and energy (28 percent. Between 2012 and 2019, Nepal’s emissions increased by 26.9 percent, primarily due to growing energy consumption in energy and industry, which accounted for 28.3 percent and 7.4 percent of Nepal’s GHG emissions in 2019. Biomass, transport, open burning, and industrial activities also contribute significantly to air pollution, with sizeable negative impacts on health and productivity.

Climate variability is impacting the Nepali economy through lower agricultural productivity, road damage, and high energy imports during the dry season, among other impacts. Floods and landslides have been the most frequent hazards over the past 40 years; these events are expected to increase as climate change accelerates. While southern and urban municipalities are more likely to experience flooding and heat stress, northern regions are affected by increased erosion, landslides, water stress, and glacial lake overflow. The most vulnerable communities often live in the most extreme environments that are subject to climate impacts and lack social protection programs. Women, indigenous people, and other marginalized communities are disproportionately affected.

Nepal has begun to put in place the necessary policy framework, such as the 2019 National Climate Change Policy, the 2022 Solid Waste Management Policy, the 2022 Forest Regulation, and the 2022 Land Use Regulation. However, implementation of this reform agenda and prioritization of investments is incipient. Moreover, enhanced prioritization and efficiency of public expenditure are required to maximize climate and development benefits.

This Country Climate and Development Report outlines four priority system transitions that are fundamental to addressing the risks that climate change poses to Nepal while also providing opportunities for improving the quality and sustainability of economic development: (a) improving systemic resilience of rural landscapes including food, freshwater, and forest systems to boost adaptation, livelihoods, and food security; (b) harnessing Nepal’s significant hydropower opportunities; (c) managing urbanization and environmental quality to build resilience and improve health; and (d) strengthening Nepal’s low-carbon, resilient connectivity — particularly roads — to improve the country’s growth and services. This report also outlines three key enabling themes to help support the priority system transitions toward a greener future for Nepal: strengthening the resilience of people and community assets through early warning systems, shock-responsive safety nets, and access to quality skills training; embedding disaster risk management at all tiers of government and across all sectors; and prioritizing Nepal’s funding needs by convening and coordinating financing for climate action.

Rapid urbanisation and climate change key drivers of dramatic flood impacts in Nepal

From 26-28 September 2024, extremely heavy rainfall hit Nepal, especially the capital Kathmandu and nearby regions, causing devastating flash floods, landslides and riverine flooding from the Bagmati, Sapakoshi, Narayani, Sardu, Rew, and Nakkhu rivers and their tributaries. In total, 244 people were killed.

The disaster has severely disrupted transportation, damaging 19 major roads. Landslides blocked all highways out of Kathmandu, with only the Prithvi Highway partially reopened. Roads across central and southern Nepal, including vital routes like the BP Highway, Mid-Hill Highway and Araniko Highway, remain partially blocked.

Researchers from Nepal, India, Sweden, Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom collaborated to assess to what extent human-induced climate change altered the likelihood and intensity of extreme rainfall that led to devastating landslides and floods.

To analyse the event, we focus on the most affected region in Nepal, including the provinces Gandaki, Bagmati, Madhesh and Koshi. The rain fell at the end of the monsoon season, when soils are generally saturated, meaning that the three days of very heavy rainfall were the main cause of the impacts. We thus use the maximum of the annual 3-day rainfall as the temporal event definition. Fig. 1 shows the accumulated 3-day rainfall over Nepal with the study region outlined in red.

Main findings

The Metropolitan areas of Kathmandu and Lalitpur are highly exposed to flooding due to their geographic location along a valley with few natural drainage points. Rapid urbanisation (386% increase in built up areas between 1990-2020) and deforestation (28% reduction in forest cover from 1989-2019) in the Kathmandu Valley has disrupted natural water processes, increasing surface runoff and overwhelming drainage systems, while building on flood plains and near rivers has increased the exposure of people and assets to floods.

Nepal has seen many heavy rainfall events followed by severe flooding in the past. Analysing different observation-based datasets, the relative magnitude of the observed event compared to previous years varies between datasets, making it difficult to estimate how rare the event is in today’s climate. According to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Government of Nepal, the rainfall recorded in several stations during the event was the highest in 54 years of measurements (DHM, 08 October 2024); therefore we use a rounded estimate of 1-in-50 years to define the event for the rest of the analysis.

To assess if human-induced climate change influenced the heavy rainfall, we first determine if there is a trend in the observations. Our best estimate is that heavy 3-day rainfall events have become about 18% more intense and just over twice more likely, but there are substantial differences between the datasets, which limit our confidence in the accuracy of these figures. The trends are stronger in the satellite era, from 1980 onwards.

To quantify the role of human-induced climate change we analyse climate models with high resolution that are in principle able to simulate the influence of the mountains on rainfall in the study region. Overall, the available climate models indicate a 10% increase in intensity compared to a 1.3C cooler climate, and an increase in likelihood of about 70%. Under a future warming scenario where the global temperature is 2°C higher than pre-industrial levels, climate models predict even heavier 3-day rainfall events, with a further expected increase of about 3% in rainfall intensity. As only the subset of models showing the smallest change in rainfall with global warming have future simulations available, this is a conservative estimate.

Given the small mountainous region with complex rainfall-climate dynamics, there is a high level of uncertainty in the results. However, the increase in heavy 3-day rainfall events is in line with a large and growing body of scientific evidence on large-scale extreme rainfall in a warming world, including in Nepal, and the physical understanding that a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to heavier downpours.

The floods were well forecasted by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), but warning messages did not focus on the impacts to the Kathmandu Valley specifically, and it’s unclear to what extent the warnings led to early action. The Kathmandu Valley is also not thefocus of flood risk management efforts in Nepal, as other regions (notably Terai) generally have been classified as high risk and have historically seen highly impactful floods. This presents an opportunity to further scale anticipatory action systems that have been shown to be cost effective in other parts of Nepal to cover highly exposed urban centres like the Kathmandu Valley.

The 2015 Gorhka earthquake destabilised hillsides and weakened drainage infrastructure, while the COVID-19 pandemic affected the incomes of low and middle class individuals representing long-term compounding factors that increased vulnerability to floods and landslides. Deforestation and rapid urbanisation expansion, especially into river floodplains, increased the number of people in the path of the flood waters. Comprehensive spatial planning, combined with disaster risk reduction and adaptation, effective policy enforcement, and increased public awareness, are crucial to mitigate flood risks across central and eastern Nepal, including the Kathmandu Valley.",title rapid urbanisation climate change key driver dramatic flood impact nepal world weather attribution published wed oct gmt source world weather attribution rapid urbanisation climate change key driver dramatic flood impact nepal september extremely heavy rainfall hit nepal especially capital kathmandu nearby region causing devastating flash flood landslide riverine flooding bagmati sapakoshi narayani sardu rew nakkhu river tributary total people killed disaster severely disrupted transportation damaging major road landslide blocked highway kathmandu prithvi highway partially reopened road across central southern nepal including vital route like bp highway mid hill highway araniko highway remain partially blocked researcher nepal india sweden australia united state united kingdom collaborated assess extent human induced climate change altered likelihood intensity extreme rainfall led devastating landslide flood analyse event focus affected region nepal including province gandaki bagmati madhesh koshi rain fell end monsoon season soil generally saturated meaning three day heavy rainfall main cause impact thus use maximum annual day rainfall temporal event definition fig show accumulated day rainfall nepal study region outlined red main finding metropolitan area kathmandu lalitpur highly exposed flooding due geographic location along valley natural drainage point rapid urbanisation increase built area deforestation reduction forest cover kathmandu valley disrupted natural water process increasing surface runoff overwhelming drainage system building flood plain near river increased exposure people asset flood nepal seen many heavy rainfall event followed severe flooding past analysing different observation based datasets relative magnitude observed event compared previous year varies datasets making difficult estimate rare event today climate according department hydrology meteorology dhm government nepal rainfall recorded several station event highest year measurement dhm october therefore use rounded estimate year define event rest analysis assess human induced climate change influenced heavy rainfall first determine trend observation best estimate heavy day rainfall event become intense twice likely substantial difference datasets limit confidence accuracy figure trend stronger satellite era onwards quantify role human induced climate change analyse climate model high resolution principle able simulate influence mountain rainfall study region overall available climate model indicate increase intensity compared c cooler climate increase likelihood future warming scenario global temperature c higher pre industrial level climate model predict even heavier day rainfall event expected increase rainfall intensity subset model showing smallest change rainfall global warming future simulation available conservative estimate given small mountainous region complex rainfall climate dynamic high level uncertainty result however increase heavy day rainfall event line large growing body scientific evidence large scale extreme rainfall warming world including nepal physical understanding warmer atmosphere hold moisture leading heavier downpour flood well forecasted department hydrology meteorology dhm warning message focus impact kathmandu valley specifically unclear extent warning led early action kathmandu valley also thefocus flood risk management effort nepal region notably terai generally classified high risk historically seen highly impactful flood present opportunity scale anticipatory action system shown cost effective part nepal cover highly exposed urban centre like kathmandu valley gorhka earthquake destabilised hillside weakened drainage infrastructure covid pandemic affected income low middle class individual representing long term compounding factor increased vulnerability flood landslide deforestation rapid urbanisation expansion especially river floodplain increased number people path flood water comprehensive spatial planning combined disaster risk reduction adaptation effective policy enforcement increased public awareness crucial mitigate flood risk across central eastern nepal including kathmandu valley,Positive,0.038353174603174604,0.47105291005290995,"Nepal -

United In the Face of Disaster: Nepal Navigates Climate Risks

For the people of Nepal, climate resilience is an everyday affair. Nearly a month ago, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake killed 128 people and injured a dozen more. In the last year alone, nearly 5,700 disaster incidents, from earthquakes to landslides, glacial floods, forest fires, incessant rains and more, struck communities across the country. As a country of 30 million people that makes a negligible contribution to global carbon emissions, this relentless stream of climate-related crises, has undone many hard-fought development gains. In his , the UN Secretary-General warned that “the rooftops of the world are caving in,” referring to the disappearance of glaciers and calling to stop climate change induced destruction.

The UN Country Team in Nepal, led by Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, has been working closely with the government, civil society and development partners to ensure that disaster risk reduction and climate resilience is an integral part of policy decisions and development programmes.

""Disaster risk reduction is at the core of ensuring sustainable development in a country as disaster-prone as Nepal. Working together collaboratively and establishing strong and sustained partnerships between government, academia, knowledge-based organizations, and UN agencies in Nepal allows us to generate collective and complementary action, as well as amplify climate adaptation efforts. We are all actively working on the UN Secretary General's initiatives on Early Warning for All to ensure no one is left behind,"" states Ms. Singer-Hamdy.

Here are four ways the UN system is helping Nepal navigate climate risks:

(i)

Data for decision-making in disasters:

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) supported the development and roll-out of a system that enables officials and citizens to report disaster incidents and potential risks in real time to ensure that planners, policymakers and “disaster managers” can make quick decisions on response and recovery and prepare ahead.  Today, the portal is available to each of Nepal’s seven provinces, 77 districts and 753 municipalities. The UN also has a long-term partnership with a consortium of universities to develop a comprehensive risk model spanning earthquakes, landslide and community resilience, which. provides sophisticated data for response activities and humanitarian planning.

(ii)

Advocating for disaster risk reduction and climate resilience at all levels:

The advocacy of the UN Country Team has been critical in helping Nepal finalize its national roadmap to meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement and set a climate target of zero net emissions by 2045. Coming into COP27, UNDP provided technical and financial support to the Government of Nepal, enhancing the country’s critical role on the establishment of the first Loss and Damage Fund and the adoption of a new UN resolution on sustainable mountain development at the General Assembly, that recognizes the unique challenges faced by mountainous states.

(iii)

Expanding budgets and investments in local governments:

With the UN’s support, all seven of Nepal’s provinces have prepared climate-responsive budgets in 2022, with three provinces establishing mechanisms to help track, manage and mobilize investments for addressing climate risk and building resilience.

Thanks to the UN’s engagement and technical support in conducting vulnerability capacity and rapid needs assessments, there has been a huge increase in public budgets for disaster preparedness in provinces and local governments across Nepal. Sudhurpaschim Province, for example, increased its annual budget allocation for disaster preparedness by 71.16 per cent this year.  Two municipalities, Dhangadi and Amargadi, increased their budgets by 672 per cent and 300 per cent respectively.

Complementing this, nearly 20,000 local government officials from more than 700 local governments were trained in local disaster risk management. Agencies such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), UNDP, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN Women helped build capacity for local leaders in areas such as emergency operations, gender-responsive disaster planning, disaster preparedness, earthquake modelling and more.

(iv)

Setting disaster risk as a cross-cutting agenda in other sectors:

When disaster strikes, it doesn’t just demand a response from climate and environment officials, but also from those responsible for health, water and sanitation, local development and more. With this aim, the UN supported the Ministry of Health and Population with policy reviews and simulation exercises to improve health sector coordination during emergencies.

UN Population Fund (UNFPA)’s support went towards ensuring that local governments’ disaster preparedness plans included provisions to tackle gender-based violence as well as essential services for sexual and reproductive health in emergencies.

In Karnali Province, the World Food Programme (WFP) has been actively engaged in a community infrastructure project, where nurseries are built, and young trees planted as a nature-based way of stabilizing areas prone to landslides.

A climate-resilient water safety plan ensuring a sustainable supply of safe water for communities was developed with support from UNICEF. Fifteen municipalities also developed child-sensitive local disaster and climate resilience plans to address children’s needs during disasters.

The coordinated and concerted efforts in Nepal stand as a lesson for other countries on the frontlines of the global climate crisis. For a future fraught with increasing risk, being prepared and responding quickly is the best hope we have.

Strengthening a Climate Smart, Green, and Resilient Education System in Nepal

Background

Nepal’s vulnerability to climate change varies by data sources, ranking from the 4th to 10th most climate-vulnerable country, and it has witnessed a range of environmental calamities and extreme weather events over the past few decades. Nepal is highly prone to natural disasters that carry a high risk of mortality. The Terai plains in the south are particularly exposed to seasonal floods caused by monsoonal rains and complex river systems, exacerbated by the construction of embankments along the rivers. The hill and mountain regions, with their fragile ecosystems, are highly susceptible to landslides and debris flows. Due to global warming, snow and ice are melting rapidly in the Himalayas, causing glacial lakes to expand and increasing the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which have the potential to cause catastrophic flash floods in far-downstream areas. Nepal has been experiencing a temperature rise and precipitation changes at a higher rate than the global average, leading to prolonged dry spells and an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts, particularly during the winter months. A drier environment and reduced rainfall in winter have also led to an increase in forest fires in recent years.

Many schools in Nepal are located in disaster-prone areas (e.g., on riverbanks and steep terrain), exposing students to high flood and landslide risks. Hydro-meteorological hazards have been disrupting student access to education and exposing learners to multiple risks when attempting to attend school during climate-induced disruptions. Therefore, it is imperative to recognize and address the interconnectedness of the climate crisis and the learning crisis, particularly in the context of Nepal, where the adverse effects of climate change significantly impact the education sector.

While Nepal does not contribute significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, its susceptibility to climate change underscores the necessity of fostering a climate-smart education system from a climate justice perspective—one that enhances the resilience of schools and learners and promotes adaptation measures in the face of growing risks. It is also important to ensure that the country’s young population is equipped with evidence-based knowledge about the impacts of climate change globally, nationally, and locally, so they can make informed decisions to adapt to these changes.

The significance of education as a change agent for climate change adaptation and mitigation has been underscored for decades; however, there is limited research and literature on the interrelation between climate change and education in Low-Income Countries (LICs) and Low-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). While there is an increasing body of research that explores the detrimental impacts of climate change on education, there is not enough evidence regarding methods to safeguard education from the effects of climate change and environmental degradation, nor the role of education in tackling climate change in developing nations. Furthermore, the lack of coherent strategies for leveraging climate change education to promote adaptation and mitigation is evident, and the intricate link between climate change education and pro-environmental behaviour remains elusive.

Despite the existing dearth of evidence, it is worthwhile to invest in exploring the potential of education in equipping the next generation to address both climate change and the biodiversity crisis, fostering their capacity for mitigation and adaptation. Therefore, prioritizing a comprehensive strategy that employs education to impart actionable knowledge and foster systemic understanding can profoundly impact pro-environmental behaviour.

By Santosh Nepal

Nepal is already grappling with the climate crisis, facing complex disasters beyond our previous experience and capacity to manage.

Unprecedented rainfall between 27 and 29 September, 2024 devastated the country. More than228 lives were lostand many remain missing. More than 15 hydropower projects, generating over 1,000 MW, were damaged. Preliminary assessments indicate losses ofNPR4.35 billion (USD 32 million)across  hydropower, irrigation, and river control infrastructure. In addition, there has been major damage to roads, settlements,andother infrastructure, the initial estimate of total loss isNPR 17 billion(126 million USD).

Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital, experienced record-breaking rainfall, with more than300 mm recordedin some parts of Kathmandu valley in just three days. The flood levels and the scale of inundation surpass anything recorded in the city’s long history. The full extent of the damage, including the destruction of homes, critical infrastructure, businesses, and agricultural land, remains to be fully evaluated.

Atypical disasters happening more frequently

In recent years, Nepal has experienced an increase in disasters driven by extreme weather, resulting in significant loss of life and property. In June 2021,a cascading series of disasters in Melamchitriggered by extreme rainfall and other hydrogeological processes caused extensive damage to the lower Indrawati region, amounting to NPR 66 billion (USD 498 million). Later that same year, an extreme rainfall event in western Nepal destroyed 110,000 ha of rice fields ready for harvest, leading to losses worth NPR 12 billion (USD 89 million).

In 2023, heavy rainfall in eastern Nepal damaged hydropower infrastructure, causing an estimated NPR 8.5 billion (USD 63 million) in damage. Then, in July 2024,in the western Nepal Kanchanpur district. This extreme weather event caused an estimated NPR 1.5 billion (USD 11 million) in damage, severely impacting agriculture, livestock, irrigation, and water supply infrastructure.

These are just a few examples of the extreme climate events Nepal has experienced in recent years. However, such unprecedented disasters are not confined to Nepal alone. We have witnessed similar extreme-weather-induced events globally, includingdevastating floods in Europe(2021), theChamoli disasterin India (2021), the catastrophicIndus River floodsin Pakistan (2022), theSikkim floodsin India (2023), andHurricane Helenein the United States (2024). These events illustrate a growing trend of climate-driven hazards impacting communities around the world – even in wealthier countries with greater adaptive capacity.

Outbursts of urgency

As one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, Nepal is experiencing some of the most severe impacts. The impacts are disproportionately felt by marginalized and Indigenous communities with limited adaptive capacity.

Increasingly, many of these communities are facing risks from rapidly melting glaciers, which can lead to glacial lake outburst floods. In August 2024,two such outburstscaused significant damage in Thame village, located in the Mt. Everest region. There are around 25,000 other glacial lakes in the Himalayas, with47 identified as potentially dangerousin the Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali river basins shared by Nepal, China, and India. However, only a few glaciers are regularly monitored, and even fewer have established early warning systems.

As global temperatures continue to rise, these risks position Nepal at the forefront of the climate crisis. The country’s unique geography, fragile ecosystems, and socioeconomic constraints increase the whole country’s vulnerability to climate change impacts. From unpredictable weather patterns and increasing climatic extremes to the accelerated melting of glaciers, Nepal’s future is becoming increasingly uncertain.

The way forward: Building climate resilience

With Nepal facing climate crises that directly impact people’s livelihoods and the national economy, building climate resilience has become an urgent priority.

First, Nepal must strengthen its disaster preparedness and early warning systems to better protect vulnerable communities from floods, landslides, and glacial lake outbursts. Investing in resilient infrastructure – such as water supply, hydropower, roads, and irrigation systems – is essential to safeguard lives and livelihoods.

Second, promoting community-based adaptation measures is crucial, particularly in rural areas. These efforts should prioritize improved water conservation, nature-based solutions, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable farming practices. Nepal has a rich history of pioneering locally led adaptation, which needs to be scaled up and expanded. Additionally, blending local and Indigenous management practices will enhance the effectiveness of these adaptation measures.

Third, the international community must support Nepal’s climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. The country’s National Adaptation Plan outlines 64 priority programs through 2050, requiring an estimated USD 47 billion for effective mitigation and adaptation (i.e. approximately USD 2 billion annually). Developed nations, which have historically contributed the majority of global emissions, must fulfill their commitments to provide financial and technical assistance to vulnerable countries like Nepal. Climate financing is essential for enabling Nepal to invest in renewable energy, enhance disaster management systems, and develop climate-resilient infrastructure. Additionally, Nepal must strengthen its policies to create an enabling environment that facilitates the flow of climate finance to effectively accelerate climate action.

As Nepal faces more frequent and severe floods, droughts, and glacial melt the need for urgent action is clear. While progress has been made much more is needed at both the national and international levels. The window of opportunity to act is closing rapidly. If the world fails to take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, vulnerable nations like Nepal will transition from experiencing climate crises to facing a full-blown climate emergency. We must act decisively and urgently now.

Nepal’s wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity, but it’s not just climate change to blame. Forest scientists say that Nepalis’ changing relationship with forests is also escalating the incidence of forest fire, but that better fire prediction and preparedness could minimize harm.

“We Live the Crisis”: Women’s Voices from Rural Nepal on the Uneven Burden of Climate Change

In recent months, I traveled across seven provinces of Nepal—some so remote that our climate awareness event was the first of its kind in the area. These were open, honest, and at times painful conversations with women who are living the climate crisis in their bodies, their fields, and their everyday lives.

What I heard wasn’t new in terms of science, but it was powerful in terms of lived truth. And that truth is this: the impacts of climate change are not gender neutral. Women in rural Nepal are being hit the hardest, and in ways that remain invisible to most policies and platforms.

“Our daughters are menstruating earlier. It hurts more now.”

One of the first things the women shared was how climate change is affecting their health—especially their reproductive health. Girls are getting their first periods earlier, sometimes even before age 10. Periods are becoming more irregular, more painful, and harder to manage, especially during hotter summers. Many linked this to heat stress, food insecurity, and a general feeling of constant illness.

These are not random stories. When women across different corners of the country voice the same concerns, it’s not anecdotal—it’s evidence.

“Our education is also at risk.”

This isn’t just about older women carrying water and farming. Even students pursuing higher education are affected. One student from Agriculture University shared how fieldwork, once a vital part of their learning, is now often canceled due to unbearable heat. “We’re supposed to learn by doing,” she said, “but now we stay indoors because it’s too hot to go outside.”

Climate change is robbing them of their education.

“We walk further for water. Our stomachs hurt all the time.”

As local water sources dry up, women are walking longer distances while carrying heavy loads of water. This has led to persistent lower abdominal pain, back problems, and constant exhaustion. One woman told me, “Carrying water is our everyday pain. But now, that pain doesn’t stop even after we put the gagri (water pot) down.”

There’s a clear link between environmental stress and physical health—but it’s not reflected in our health systems, nor is it being discussed enough.

“The rain is confused. So are our crops.”

Farming has always been backbreaking, but now it's unpredictable too. Rain no longer comes on time. Sometimes it’s too much, other times none at all. Crops are failing. On the same land where women once grew three types of grains, they can now barely grow one—and with much more effort than before.

Previously, they watered the fields once a day. Now, they spend a week just trying to get one crop to sprout. Time poverty is real—and it’s gendered.

“We are not just victims. We are also holding our families together.”

Despite everything, women continue to run households, raise children, farm, fetch water, and feed others. And still, they show up—learning, sharing, and asking questions at climate events that often mark their first moment of public recognition.

This is not just a climate crisis—it’s a justice crisis. These testimonies are not data points. They are real lives, marked by pain, adaptation, resilience, and resistance. What I saw and heard is clear: climate justice must be gender justice. We must listen to women, center their voices, and act on their truths—not because they are victims, but because they are leaders. Because they see what’s happening more clearly than anyone else.

This isn’t just about survival. It’s about rights. It’s about justice. And it’s long overdue.

Nepal floods deliver US$127 million blow to country’s economy amid climate challenges

September’s floods caused millions in damages, displacing thousands and threatening economic growth, as climate change exacerbates future risks

September’s floods caused millions in damages, displacing thousands and threatening economic growth, as climate change exacerbates future risks

Rajan Bajagain is faced with the heartbreaking sight of his home reduced to rubble, as the land where he once farmed is now submerged under a thick layer of muddy sludge.

“Our world has ended,” Bajagain, 53, said. “I lost everything I earned, and our source of livelihood has been washed away. Our farms and crops have been completely destroyed.”

Floods and landslides caused by torrential downpours wreaked havoc across Nepal, killing at least 236 people and resulting in widespread destruction. A preliminary government report estimates economic losses worth 17 billion rupees (US$127 million), but some economists say the figure could be even higher.

“It was unusual for that kind of flooding in September,” said Kabir Uddin, geographic information system and remote sensing specialist at the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. “Climate change is triggering the problem and bringing along economic losses.”
