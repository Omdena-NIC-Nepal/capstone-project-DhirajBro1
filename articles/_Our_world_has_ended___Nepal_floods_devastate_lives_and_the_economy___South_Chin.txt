Rajan Bajagain is faced with the heartbreaking sight of his home reduced to rubble, as the land where he once farmed is now submerged under a thick layer of muddy sludge.

“Our world has ended,” Bajagain, 53, said. “I lost everything I earned, and our source of livelihood has been washed away. Our farms and crops have been completely destroyed.”

Floods and landslides caused by torrential downpours wreaked havoc across Nepal, killing at least 236 people and resulting in widespread destruction. A preliminary government report estimates economic losses worth 17 billion rupees (US$127 million), but some economists say the figure could be even higher.

“It was unusual for that kind of flooding in September,” said Kabir Uddin, geographic information system and remote sensing specialist at the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. “Climate change is triggering the problem and bringing along economic losses.”
